# Research Phase Documentation

This directory contains all technical research and discovery artifacts for the "Network Like a Hyperscaler" learning pathway.

## Purpose

Phase 1 research validates consultant planning documents against actual Hedgehog capabilities in the vlab environment. This research informs all subsequent content development.

## Research Documents

### Planned
- **VLAB_CAPABILITIES.md** - Complete vlab environment documentation
- **CRD_REFERENCE.md** - Comprehensive CRD documentation with tested examples
- **WORKFLOWS.md** - Step-by-step workflows for common operations
- **OBSERVABILITY.md** - Monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities
- **TECHNICAL_MAPPING.md** - Consultant concepts mapped to Hedgehog reality
- **CURRICULUM_ADJUSTMENTS.md** - Recommended modifications to consultant plan

## Research Issues

- [#1 - Vlab Environment Exploration and CRD Documentation](https://github.com/afewell-hh/learn-content-scratchpad/issues/1)
- [#2 - Technical Mapping: Consultant Concepts to Hedgehog Reality](https://github.com/afewell-hh/learn-content-scratchpad/issues/2)

## Success Criteria

Research phase is complete when:
- [ ] All vlab capabilities documented and verified
- [ ] All Hedgehog CRDs documented with working examples
- [ ] Common workflows tested and documented
- [ ] Consultant concepts mapped to reality
- [ ] Gaps identified with proposed solutions
- [ ] Curriculum adjustments recommended
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Architecture & Design)

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough**: This research informs the entire curriculum
- **Test everything**: Don't assume - verify in live vlab
- **Document limitations**: Note what's not available or doesn't work as expected
- **Provide examples**: All CRD documentation should include tested YAML
- **Think pedagogically**: Consider how learners will interact with these concepts
