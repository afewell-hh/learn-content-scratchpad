## Certification Branding & Messaging Sheet

**Name / Title Options**

* *Network like a Hyperscaler with Hedgehog*
* *Hedgehog Certified Fabric Operator (HCFO)*

**Tagline / Subtitle**

* “Operate hyperscaler-grade network abstractions in hours — be production-ready with Hedgehog.”
* “From zero to confident fabric admin — the certification that bridges cloud-native abstractions and high-performance networking.”

---

## Value Proposition & Core Messaging

### Promise

* Equip you to **safely administer a production Hedgehog fabric** — provisioning, connectivity, observability, failure recovery, and escalations — without needing years of traditional networking training
* Empower engineers to adopt **hyperscaler-style abstractions** in their own datacenters
* Signal credibility: this is a **real certification**, not a “self-paced quiz badge”

### Differentiators (Why HCFO is not “just another networking cert”)

* Uses **cloud-native abstractions, not legacy network jargon**
* Focused on **practical, day-to-day operations**, not rarely used corner cases
* Includes **hands-on lab with GitOps, observability, rollback, fault injection**
* Emphasizes **escalation & safe fallback**, not manual deep diving in every failure
* Designed to be **short, composable, rigorous** — “less effort than CCNA, but deeper in relevant fields”

### Target Audience

* Engineers with **cloud-native / Kubernetes experience** but limited network grounding
* Networking professionals who want to **step into cloud-first fabric management**
* Ops teams, SREs, infrastructure engineers, partner integrators

### Certification Outcomes / Skills

Upon passing HCFO, a learner will be able to:

1. Define and manage tenant networks, host attachments, gateways, and peering via CRDs/YAML
2. Validate connectivity and path correctness
3. Monitor fabric health via dashboards, metrics, logs, and events
4. Diagnose common issues, revert changes, and prepare diagnostic packages
5. Work confidently with GitOps / ArgoCD integration and declarative updates
6. Understand when and how to escalate to support, and how to package useful diagnostic information

## Certification Structure & Format

| Element                         | Proposed Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pathway / Curriculum**        | The 4-course / 16-module pathway (as we’ve outlined) with optional supplementary modules for background topics                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Capstone / Final Assessment** | A timed hands-on lab scenario (in the same lab environment) where the learner must accomplish a set of tasks: e.g. provision a network + host, inject a fault, diagnose, rollback, and validate. Their results / logs / remediation steps form part of scoring. |
| **Grading / Passing Criteria**  | Combination of module quizzes + capstone success criteria (e.g. all tasks completed within error thresholds)                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Badge / Certificate Format**  | Digital certificate + badge (e.g. HCFO) that learners can share on LinkedIn / resume. Optionally, include issuance date + version number (so later upgrades / recertification can be tracked)                                                                   |
| **Recertification / Renewal**   | Consider requiring a renewal every 1–2 years, or via a shorter refresher / exam to remain current as software evolves                                                                                                                                           |

### Buyer / Decision Maker Pitch (for sales, partner, executive)

> **Why HCFO matters for organizations**
>
> * **Faster onboarding:** Engineers reach operational capability in hours, not weeks
> * **Lower risk:** Built-in practices encourage safe rollbacks, diagnostics, and early escalation
> * **Standards & credibility:** Certified engineers reduce handoffs and bottlenecks
> * **Scalable operations:** As infrastructure grows, your team is already fluent in abstractions and guardrails

### FAQ / Objections & Rebuttals

| Objection                                                                | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| This sounds “too easy” — can a serious operator learn in so little time? | The goal isn’t to produce network wizards in hours — it’s to build confidence and operational fluency in core, high-impact tasks. For advanced cases, deeper learning tracks / support collaboration exists.                                                                           |
| What about advanced protocols, edge cases, hardware-specific tuning?     | HCFO focuses on “what matters.” We cover fundamentals of diagnostics and escalation. Advanced or rarely used features are available in supplementary courses or vendor/partner deep dives.                                                                                             |
| Will this cert hold weight compared to traditional certs (CCNA, CCNP)?   | It’s a new paradigm. HCFO emphasizes modern fabric operation, cloud-native abstractions, and safe guardrails. In environments using Hedgehog, it becomes the most relevant credential. ▫ We can also position advanced levels later (e.g. HCFA — Hedgehog Certified Fabric Architect). |
| What happens if software versions change or APIs evolve?                 | Certification includes versioning. We’ll define recertification / upgrade paths. Learners will also gain skills to read and adapt to API changes by design.                                                                                                                            |
