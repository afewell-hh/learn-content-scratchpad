# Phase 3: Content Development Plan

## Overview

**Phase:** 3 - Content Development
**Status:** ðŸš€ READY TO START
**Started:** TBD
**Goal:** Transform 16 approved module designs into polished, production-ready learning content

## Phase 2 Completion Summary

### Deliverables Inherited from Phase 2
- âœ… All 16 core module designs (Courses 1-4) - 100% approved
- âœ… Ideal environment setup (EMKC with Prometheus/Grafana/ArgoCD/Gitea)
- âœ… Module dependency graph (MODULE_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)
- âœ… Capstone assessment design (CAPSTONE_ASSESSMENT_DESIGN.md)
- âœ… Comprehensive research documentation (Phase 1: 3,600+ lines)

### Quality Standards Established
- **Learning Philosophy:** 10 principles embedded in every module
- **Timing Target:** 15 minutes per module (~4 hours total pathway)
- **Hands-On Focus:** Every module includes tested lab exercises
- **Dual Audience:** Accessible to both cloud-native and networking professionals
- **Technical Accuracy:** All CRDs, commands, and workflows validated against vlab

---

## IMPORTANT: Format Remediation Required

**Status:** ðŸš¨ Course 1 modules (1.1-1.4) completed but in WRONG FORMAT

**Issue Discovered:** 2025-10-16
- Course 1 modules written in incorrect format (flat markdown files)
- hh-learn platform requires specific structure: modules in `content/modules/[slug]/README.md`
- Missing YAML front matter with required fields
- Missing course JSON and pathway JSON files

**Remediation Plan:**
- See detailed analysis: `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/learn_content_scratchpad/network-like-hyperscaler/HH-LEARN_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md`
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours to convert all 4 Course 1 modules
- Must complete before continuing with Course 2 development

**Next Steps:**
1. Convert Course 1 modules (1.1-1.4) to proper hh-learn format
2. Create course JSON for Course 1: `network-like-hyperscaler-foundations.json`
3. Create/update pathway JSON: `network-like-hyperscaler.json`
4. Test with `npm run sync:content`
5. Resume Course 2 development using correct format from the start

---

## Phase 3 Approach

### Development Methodology

**Iterative, Module-by-Module Content Development**

1. **Select Next Module** (follow critical path from MODULE_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)
2. **Agent Dispatch** (create detailed GitHub issue with full context)
3. **Content Development** (agent transforms design â†’ polished content in CORRECT FORMAT)
4. **Course Lead Review** (quality gates, philosophy alignment, technical accuracy, FORMAT COMPLIANCE)
5. **Approval/Iteration** (approve or request revisions)
6. **Commit & Close** (merge to main, close issue)
7. **Repeat** for next module

**Critical Path Order:**
```
Module 1.1 â†’ 1.2 â†’ 1.3 â†’ 1.4 â†’ 2.1 â†’ 2.2 â†’ 2.3 â†’ 2.4 â†’ 3.1 â†’ 3.2 â†’ 3.3 â†’ 3.4 â†’ 4.1 â†’ 4.2 â†’ 4.3 â†’ 4.4
```

**Rationale:**
- Linear progression ensures prerequisite knowledge is available
- Course boundaries provide natural checkpoints
- Module-by-module approach enables high-quality, focused development
- Agent specialization allows course lead to maintain oversight and context

---

## Content Development Standards

### Input: Module Design Document

Each module has a comprehensive design document in `designs/module-X.X-design.md` containing:

1. **Module Metadata** (title, duration, prerequisites)
2. **Learning Objectives** (5 specific, measurable outcomes)
3. **Content Outline** (introduction, core concepts, hands-on lab, wrap-up)
4. **Assessment Design** (5 quiz questions with explanations + practical assessment)
5. **Technical Requirements** (CRDs used, kubectl commands, tools)
6. **Pedagogical Design** (learning philosophy principles, audience considerations, common challenges)
7. **Dependencies** (prerequisites, enables, related modules)
8. **Quality Checklist** (design quality, technical accuracy, philosophy alignment, accessibility, completeness)

**Location:** `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/learn_content_scratchpad/network-like-hyperscaler/designs/`

### Output: Polished Module Content

1. âœ… **Polished Module Content** - Markdown file at target location
2. âœ… **Content Quality Report** - Brief summary of:
   - Technical validation status (did you test commands/labs in vlab?)
   - Learning philosophy principles embedded
   - Estimated completion time (15-minute target check)
   - Any deviations from design (with rationale)

## Important Notes

- **Respect the design:** The design was carefully crafted and approved. Follow it closely unless you find a technical error or improvement.
- **Technical accuracy is critical:** If a command doesn't work or a CRD field is wrong, flag it and suggest a fix.
- **Learning philosophy matters:** This isn't just documentationâ€”it's learning content designed to build confidence and competence.
- **Audience is dual:** Content must be accessible to both Kubernetes/cloud-native learners AND traditional networking professionals.
- **Hands-on is mandatory:** The lab section is the most important part. Make it detailed, testable, and achievable.

- **Owner:** Course lead (track timing, adjust in Phase 4)

### Risk 3: Learning Philosophy Drift
- **Mitigation:** Explicit quality gate check on every module
- **Owner:** Course lead (philosophy guardian)

### Risk 4: Content Inconsistency Across Modules
- **Mitigation:** Use standard template, course lead reviews for consistency
- **Owner:** Course lead

### Risk 5: Context Loss for Ephemeral Agents
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive issue templates with full context
- **Owner:** Course lead (create detailed dispatches)
