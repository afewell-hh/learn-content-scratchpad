# Phase 3: Content Development Plan

## Overview

**Phase:** 3 - Content Development
**Status:** ðŸš€ READY TO START
**Started:** TBD
**Goal:** Transform 16 approved module designs into polished, production-ready learning content

## Phase 2 Completion Summary

### Deliverables Inherited from Phase 2
- âœ… All 16 core module designs (Courses 1-4) - 100% approved
- âœ… Ideal environment setup (EMKC with Prometheus/Grafana/ArgoCD/Gitea)
- âœ… Module dependency graph (MODULE_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)
- âœ… Capstone assessment design (CAPSTONE_ASSESSMENT_DESIGN.md)
- âœ… Comprehensive research documentation (Phase 1: 3,600+ lines)

### Quality Standards Established
- **Learning Philosophy:** 10 principles embedded in every module
- **Timing Target:** 15 minutes per module (~4 hours total pathway)
- **Hands-On Focus:** Every module includes tested lab exercises
- **Dual Audience:** Accessible to both cloud-native and networking professionals
- **Technical Accuracy:** All CRDs, commands, and workflows validated against vlab

---

## Phase 3 Approach

### Development Methodology

**Iterative, Module-by-Module Content Development**

1. **Select Next Module** (follow critical path from MODULE_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)
2. **Agent Dispatch** (create detailed GitHub issue with full context)
3. **Content Development** (agent transforms design â†’ polished content)
4. **Course Lead Review** (quality gates, philosophy alignment, technical accuracy)
5. **Approval/Iteration** (approve or request revisions)
6. **Commit & Close** (merge to main, close issue)
7. **Repeat** for next module

**Critical Path Order:**
```
Module 1.1 â†’ 1.2 â†’ 1.3 â†’ 1.4 â†’ 2.1 â†’ 2.2 â†’ 2.3 â†’ 2.4 â†’ 3.1 â†’ 3.2 â†’ 3.3 â†’ 3.4 â†’ 4.1 â†’ 4.2 â†’ 4.3 â†’ 4.4
```

**Rationale:**
- Linear progression ensures prerequisite knowledge is available
- Course boundaries provide natural checkpoints
- Module-by-module approach enables high-quality, focused development
- Agent specialization allows course lead to maintain oversight and context

## Deliverables

**When you're done, post to this issue:**

1. âœ… **Polished Module Content** - Markdown file at target location
2. âœ… **Content Quality Report** - Brief summary of:
   - Technical validation status (did you test commands/labs in vlab?)
   - Learning philosophy principles embedded
   - Estimated completion time (15-minute target check)
   - Any deviations from design (with rationale)
3. âœ… **Self-Quality Check** - Confirm all 7 quality gates passed

**Do NOT commit directly.** Post your work to this issue for course lead review. Course lead will review, request changes if needed, then commit on approval.

## Important Notes

- **Respect the design:** The design was carefully crafted and approved. Follow it closely unless you find a technical error or improvement.
- **Technical accuracy is critical:** If a command doesn't work or a CRD field is wrong, flag it and suggest a fix.
- **Learning philosophy matters:** This isn't just documentationâ€”it's learning content designed to build confidence and competence.
- **Audience is dual:** Content must be accessible to both Kubernetes/cloud-native learners AND traditional networking professionals.
- **Hands-on is mandatory:** The lab section is the most important part. Make it detailed, testable, and achievable.
