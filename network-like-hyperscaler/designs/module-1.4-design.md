## Content Outline

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**Hook: You've Come a Long Way**

> Three modules ago, you might have thought managing network infrastructure meant SSH-ing into switches, typing arcane commands, and hoping nothing breaks. Now you know better.
>
> You've explored a production-style fabric using kubectl. You've created a VPC using GitOps. You've monitored switches with Grafana dashboards. You've learned to think like a Hedgehog operator.
>
> Before we move forward, let's take a moment to consolidate what you've learned—and preview where you're going next.

**Context: Course 1 Completion**

This module marks the completion of Course 1: Foundations & Interfaces. You've built the foundation—now it's time to build on it.

---

### Course 1 Summary (3-4 minutes)

#### Module 1.1 Recap: Welcome to Fabric Operations (30 seconds)

**What You Learned:**
- Hedgehog Fabric is **pre-installed, declaratively-managed infrastructure**
- Your role as a **Fabric Operator**: provision, validate, monitor, troubleshoot (not physical installation)
- **Kubernetes-native management**: Network resources represented as CRDs
- **Day 2 operations focus**: Working with existing fabric, not building from scratch

**Key Moment:**
You successfully explored the fabric topology using kubectl—listing switches, servers, and connections—without touching a single switch CLI. That was your first taste of abstraction as empowerment.

**Confidence Win:**
"I can navigate a fabric environment safely using kubectl commands."

---

#### Module 1.2 Recap: How Hedgehog Works - The Control Model (1 minute)

**What You Learned:**
- **GitOps workflow**: Git (source of truth) → ArgoCD (deployment) → Fabric Controller (orchestration) → Agent CRDs (bridge) → Switch Agents (execution)
- **Three operational interfaces**:
  - **Gitea**: Write/configure (edit YAML, commit changes)
  - **ArgoCD**: Deploy/observe (sync status, deployment progress)
  - **Grafana**: Monitor/validate (dashboards, metrics, trends)
- **Declarative infrastructure**: You declare desired state, the system handles reconciliation
- **Your first VPC**: Created `myfirst-vpc` using the browser-based GitOps workflow

**Key Moment:**
You committed a VPC configuration to Git, watched ArgoCD sync it, validated with kubectl, and observed it in Grafana—all without SSHing to a single switch. The abstraction clicked.

**Confidence Win:**
"I can create a VPC using the GitOps workflow and observe the reconciliation happen across all three interfaces."

---

#### Module 1.3 Recap: Mastering the Three Interfaces (1 minute)

**What You Learned:**
- **When to use each interface**:
  - **kubectl**: Read/inspect current state, check events, troubleshoot
  - **Gitea**: Write configurations, audit history, review diffs
  - **Grafana**: Observe trends, monitor health, aggregate metrics
- **Event-based reconciliation**: VPCs use events (no error events = success)
- **All 6 Grafana dashboards**: Fabric, Platform, Interfaces, Logs, Node Exporter, CRM
- **Troubleshooting methodology**: Check config (Gitea) → Verify deployment (kubectl) → Monitor health (Grafana)
- **Agent CRDs as source of truth**: Switches report detailed operational state

**Key Moment:**
You navigated all three interfaces fluently, correlating information across tools to understand fabric state. You learned to select the right tool for the job.

**Confidence Win:**
"I know which interface to use for any given task, and I can troubleshoot by correlating data across kubectl, Gitea, and Grafana."

```

**Real-World Operator Day:**
1. Check Grafana Fabric Dashboard (morning health check)
2. Provision new VPC via Gitea (project requirement)
3. Watch ArgoCD sync the change (verify deployment)
4. Use kubectl to validate reconciliation (check events)
5. Monitor Grafana Interfaces Dashboard (confirm VLANs applied)
6. Move on to next task, confident the fabric handled the details

**You Now Operate Like a Hyperscaler:**
- Infrastructure as code (Git)
- Automated reconciliation (controllers)
- Multi-layer observability (events, metrics, logs)
- Confidence through abstraction (no manual switch config)

### Knowledge Check (2-3 minutes)

These questions help reinforce key concepts. They're not graded—they're for your own confidence check.

#### Question 1: Fabric Foundation

**Scenario:** Your manager asks, "What's a Fabric Operator's primary responsibility?"

Which answer best describes your role?

- A) Design network topologies and select switch hardware
- B) Provision VPCs, validate connectivity, and monitor fabric health
- C) Manually configure BGP on switches
- D) Install and cable physical switches

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) Provision VPCs, validate connectivity, and monitor fabric health

**Explanation:** As a Fabric Operator, you manage Day 2 operations on pre-installed infrastructure. The physical fabric (switches, cabling) is already deployed. Your focus is on creating and managing virtual network resources (VPCs), ensuring connectivity works, and monitoring fabric health.

- A is incorrect: Design is typically done during Day 0/1 (before operator role)
- C is incorrect: You don't manually configure switches—controllers handle that
- D is incorrect: Physical installation is Day 0 work, not Day 2 operations

**Module 1.1 Reference:** Fabric Operator role definition
</details>

---

#### Question 2: GitOps Workflow

**Scenario:** You need to create a new VPC called `dev-network`. What's the correct order of operations?

- A) kubectl apply → ArgoCD sync → Git commit → Grafana check
- B) Git commit (Gitea) → ArgoCD sync → kubectl validate → Grafana monitor
- C) Grafana monitor → Git commit → kubectl apply → ArgoCD sync
- D) ArgoCD sync → kubectl validate → Git commit → Grafana check

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) Git commit (Gitea) → ArgoCD sync → kubectl validate → Grafana monitor

**Explanation:** The GitOps workflow follows this sequence:
1. **Git commit (Gitea):** Create VPC YAML file, commit to repository (source of truth)
2. **ArgoCD sync:** ArgoCD detects change and deploys VPC CRD to VLAB cluster
3. **kubectl validate:** Verify VPC created, check events for reconciliation status
4. **Grafana monitor:** Observe fabric metrics confirm VPC is operational

Other options break the GitOps pattern (Git must be first) or have incorrect sequence.

**Module 1.2 Reference:** GitOps control model, five-actor flow
</details>

---

#### Question 3: Interface Selection

**Scenario:** You suspect a VPC isn't working correctly. Which interface should you check FIRST to understand the problem?

- A) Gitea (check VPC configuration)
- B) Grafana (check switch health)
- C) kubectl (check VPC events for errors)
- D) ArgoCD (check sync status)

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** C) kubectl (check VPC events for errors)

**Explanation:** When troubleshooting a non-working VPC, start with `kubectl describe vpc <name>` to check events. Hedgehog uses event-based reconciliation for VPCs—error events immediately tell you what's wrong (e.g., "Subnet overlaps with existing VPC").

After checking events:
- If events show a **configuration error** → Fix in Gitea
- If events show **no errors but VPC still not working** → Check Grafana for switch health
- If **VPC doesn't exist** → Check ArgoCD sync status

Starting with kubectl events gives you the most direct troubleshooting information.

**Module 1.3 Reference:** Troubleshooting methodology, event-based reconciliation
</details>

---

#### Question 4: Three Interfaces - Decision Making

**Match each task to the appropriate interface:**

| Task | Interface |
|------|-----------|
| 1. View historical CPU usage trends for spine-01 over 24 hours | ? |
| 2. See who changed the `prod-vpc` configuration last week | ? |
| 3. Check if a VPC has reconciliation errors | ? |
| 4. Create a new VPC with subnet 10.20.30.0/24 | ? |

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

**Answers:**
1. **Grafana** - Time-series metrics and trends (Node Exporter Dashboard)
2. **Gitea** - Audit trail / commit history (shows author and timestamp)
3. **kubectl** - Current state and events (`kubectl describe vpc <name>`)
4. **Gitea** - Write configuration (create YAML file, commit to Git)

**Key Principle:**
- **kubectl = Read** (inspect current state, events)
- **Gitea = Write** (configure, audit)
- **Grafana = Observe** (trends, metrics, monitoring)

**Module 1.3 Reference:** Interface decision matrix
</details>

---

### Knowledge Check Summary

**How did you do?**
- **4/4 correct**: Excellent! You've mastered the foundational concepts.
- **3/4 correct**: Strong understanding. Review any questions you missed.
- **2/4 or fewer**: Revisit Modules 1.1-1.3 to reinforce concepts.

**Remember:** These are for your benefit. Course 2 builds on these foundations, so make sure you feel confident before moving forward.

---

### Forward Map to Course 2 (2-3 minutes)

#### Course 1 vs Course 2: What Changes?

**Course 1 (Where You Are Now):**
- ✅ Understood how Hedgehog Fabric works
- ✅ Learned the GitOps workflow
- ✅ Mastered the three operational interfaces
- ✅ Created a simple VPC (`myfirst-vpc`)
- ✅ Observed fabric health in Grafana

**Key characteristic:** **Exploration and understanding** (read-only focus + one simple VPC)

---

**Course 2 (Where You're Going):**
- 🎯 Design and create VPCs from scratch (subnet planning, VLAN allocation)
- 🎯 Attach servers to VPCs (VPCAttachment CRD)
- 🎯 Validate end-to-end connectivity (testing workflows)
- 🎯 Decommission resources safely (cleanup procedures)
- 🎯 Handle real-world provisioning scenarios

**Key characteristic:** **Hands-on provisioning operations** (creating, modifying, validating, deleting)

---

#### Preview: Course 2 Modules

##### Module 2.1: Define VPC Network
**What You'll Learn:**
- VPC design considerations (subnet sizing, IP allocation)
- VLAN selection from namespaces (avoiding conflicts)
- Multi-subnet VPCs (multiple L2 domains)
- DHCP configuration options (ranges, reservations)
- IPv4/VLAN namespace concepts

**Hands-On:**
- Create a VPC with multiple subnets
- Configure DHCP with custom ranges
- Plan IP allocation for a multi-tenant scenario

**What's New:**
You'll make design decisions (not just follow templates). Which subnet size? Which VLAN? These choices have operational consequences.

---

##### Module 2.2: Attach Servers to VPC
**What You'll Learn:**
- VPCAttachment CRD (binding servers to VPCs)
- Connection types (MCLAG, ESLAG, unbundled, bundled)
- Subnet selection for attachments
- Server inventory review (which servers are available?)

**Hands-On:**
- Attach a server to your VPC
- Verify switch configuration (VLAN on correct ports)
- Observe VPCAttachment reconciliation in Grafana
- Troubleshoot attachment failures

**What's New:**
You'll connect virtual networks (VPCs) to physical infrastructure (servers). This bridges abstraction layers.

---

##### Module 2.3: Connectivity Validation
**What You'll Learn:**
- End-to-end connectivity testing workflows
- Using kubectl to inspect Agent CRD interface states
- Reading Grafana metrics to confirm traffic flow
- Troubleshooting common connectivity issues
- Understanding DHCP relay (switches forwarding DHCP requests)

**Hands-On:**
- Validate server can obtain DHCP lease
- Test server-to-server connectivity within VPC
- Use Grafana Interfaces Dashboard to confirm VLANs applied
- Diagnose and fix a misconfigured attachment

**What's New:**
You'll validate that your configurations actually work (not just trust reconciliation). Testing builds operational confidence.

---

##### Module 2.4: Decommission & Cleanup
**What You'll Learn:**
- Safe VPC deletion order (attachments first, then VPC)
- Verifying no active servers before deletion
- GitOps deletion workflow (delete YAML from Git)
- Cleanup validation (ensure switches removed config)
- When to archive vs delete configurations

**Hands-On:**
- Safely decommission a VPC
- Remove VPCAttachments first (proper order)
- Verify cleanup in kubectl and Grafana
- Understand orphaned resource prevention

**What's New:**
You'll learn to undo your work safely. Decommissioning is a critical Day 2 skill often overlooked in training.

---

#### Course 2: What You'll Be Able to Do

By the end of Course 2, you'll be able to:

1. **Design VPCs** tailored to specific workload requirements
2. **Provision VPCs** using GitOps workflow confidently
3. **Attach servers** to VPCs with correct connection types
4. **Validate connectivity** end-to-end (DHCP, ping, traffic)
5. **Troubleshoot** provisioning issues using all three interfaces
6. **Decommission** VPCs and attachments safely
7. **Operate independently** for common Day 2 provisioning tasks

**This is when you become productive as a Fabric Operator.**

---

### Motivation & Next Steps (1 minute)

#### You're Ready

**Course 1 gave you the foundation:**
- You understand the fabric architecture
- You know the GitOps workflow
- You've mastered the three operational interfaces
- You've created a VPC and observed reconciliation

**Course 2 will give you the skills:**
- VPC design and provisioning
- Server connectivity
- Validation and troubleshooting
- Lifecycle management (create → use → decommission)

**The difference?** Course 1 was about **understanding how Hedgehog works**. Course 2 is about **getting work done as a Fabric Operator**.

---

#### Confidence Statement

You've completed Course 1, which means:

✅ You can navigate Hedgehog Fabric using kubectl
✅ You understand GitOps workflow and why it matters
✅ You know which interface to use for any task
✅ You've successfully created a VPC using the three interfaces
✅ You can troubleshoot by correlating data across kubectl, Gitea, and Grafana

**You're not an expert yet—that's not the goal.** You're a **confident beginner** ready to tackle hands-on provisioning operations. That's exactly where you should be.

---

#### What Happens Next

**Immediate Next Step:**
Begin **Course 2, Module 2.1: Define VPC Network**

You'll design your first production-style VPC from scratch, making real design decisions about subnets and VLANs. Everything you learned in Course 1 will be applied.

**Mindset for Course 2:**
- **Experiment:** You're working in a lab environment—try things, make mistakes, learn
- **Validate:** Use all three interfaces to confirm your work
- **Troubleshoot:** When things don't work (and they won't always), you have the tools to diagnose
- **Escalate:** If you're stuck, that's normal—support is part of learning

**Remember the Learning Philosophy:**
- Confidence before comprehensiveness
- Focus on what matters most
- Learn by doing, not watching
- Support is strength, not weakness

---

#### Final Encouragement

Three modules ago, this might have seemed daunting:
> "Manage a data center network using GitOps and Kubernetes? That's not for me."

Now you know it's not just possible—**you've already done it.**

The leap from Course 1 to Course 2 is smaller than it feels. You have the foundation. Course 2 just adds depth and practice.

**Trust your preparation. You've earned this confidence.**

Welcome to Course 2. Let's get to work.

---

## Lab Exercise Specification

### Lab Environment

**Note:** Module 1.4 has **NO hands-on lab**. This is intentionally a recap and transition module.

**Required Resources:**
- N/A (no hands-on exercises)

**Why No Lab?**
- This module consolidates learning from Modules 1.1-1.3
- Knowledge check questions replace hands-on validation
- Students need mental space to reflect before Course 2
- 8-10 minute target accommodates recap + preview (no time for lab)

**If Additional Reinforcement Needed (Optional):**
Students can optionally revisit their `myfirst-vpc` from Module 1.2:
```bash
# Review your VPC
kubectl get vpc myfirst-vpc -o yaml

# Check events (should be no errors)
kubectl describe vpc myfirst-vpc

# View in Grafana
# Open http://localhost:3000 → Fabric Dashboard → see myfirst-vpc
```

This is **optional self-directed review**, not a required lab component.

---

## Assessment Design

### Knowledge Check Questions (Already Embedded Above)

**Note:** Module 1.4 uses **self-check questions** embedded in the content (not graded assessment).

The four knowledge check questions above serve as formative assessment:
1. Question 1: Fabric Operator role (tests Module 1.1 understanding)
2. Question 2: GitOps workflow (tests Module 1.2 understanding)
3. Question 3: Interface selection for troubleshooting (tests Module 1.3 understanding)
4. Question 4: Interface decision-making (tests Module 1.3 mastery)

**Assessment Philosophy:**
- **Self-check format** (answers provided for immediate feedback)
- **Non-graded** (confidence-building, not testing)
- **Scenario-based** (apply knowledge, don't just recall)
- **Low stakes** (encourages honest self-assessment)

**Pass Criteria:**
Students should feel confident in 3-4 out of 4 questions. If not, they're encouraged to revisit relevant modules.

---

### Optional Practical Assessment (For Instructor-Led Settings)

If running this as an instructor-led course, consider this optional practical assessment:

**Task:** Describe your troubleshooting approach

**Scenario:**
A colleague tells you: "I created a VPC called `test-network` in Gitea 30 minutes ago, but I don't see it in the fabric. Can you help?"

**Student Response Required:**
Describe the steps you would take to troubleshoot this issue, including:
1. Which interface you'd check first, and what you'd look for
2. What you'd check next if the first interface doesn't reveal the issue
3. Which interface you'd check third
4. What final validation you'd perform if the issue is resolved

**Rubric:**
- ✅ **Excellent (4/4):** Describes systematic troubleshooting using all three interfaces in logical order (Gitea → ArgoCD/kubectl → Grafana)
- ✅ **Good (3/4):** Describes troubleshooting approach but misses one interface or has slightly incorrect order
- ✅ **Adequate (2/4):** Identifies relevant interfaces but approach is somewhat disorganized
- ❌ **Needs Review (0-1/4):** Cannot articulate coherent troubleshooting approach or misidentifies appropriate interfaces

**Example Excellent Answer:**
1. **Check ArgoCD sync status** - Verify if Git commit was actually deployed (Application synced? Healthy?)
2. **Check kubectl** - If ArgoCD synced, verify VPC exists: `kubectl get vpc test-network`. Check events: `kubectl describe vpc test-network` (any errors?)
3. **Check Gitea** - If kubectl shows errors, review VPC configuration in Gitea (syntax errors? Subnet conflicts?)
4. **Validate in Grafana** - Once resolved, check Fabric Dashboard to confirm VPC appears and switches are healthy

---

## Technical Requirements

### Hedgehog CRDs Used

**Note:** Module 1.4 is recap-only (no new CRDs introduced).

References to CRDs from Modules 1.1-1.3:
- ✅ **VPC** - [Reference](../research/CRD_REFERENCE.md#vpc) - Created in Module 1.2
- ✅ **Agent** (switches) - [Reference](../research/CRD_REFERENCE.md#agent) - Explored in Modules 1.1, 1.3
- ✅ **Connection** - [Reference](../research/CRD_REFERENCE.md#connection) - Explored in Module 1.1

Preview of Course 2 CRDs (mentioned but not used):
- 📋 **VPCAttachment** - [Reference](../research/CRD_REFERENCE.md#vpcattachment) - Used in Module 2.2
- 📋 **IPv4Namespace / VLANNamespace** - [Reference](../research/CRD_REFERENCE.md#namespaces) - Used in Module 2.1

### kubectl Commands

**Note:** Module 1.4 has no hands-on lab, so no new commands are taught.

**Recap of Course 1 Commands:**
```bash
# From Module 1.1 (explore fabric)
kubectl get switches
kubectl get servers
kubectl get connections
kubectl describe switch <name>

# From Module 1.2 (verify VPC)

**No new tools introduced in Module 1.4.**

---

## Pedagogical Design

### Learning Philosophy Principles Emphasized

- ✅ **Confidence Before Comprehensiveness**
  - **How:** Explicitly state what students have accomplished, not what they don't know yet
  - **Example:** "You're a confident beginner ready for Day 2 operations" (not "you still have a lot to learn")
  - **Why:** Building on success creates momentum for Course 2

- ✅ **Focus on What Matters Most**
  - **How:** Recap focuses on core operational workflow (GitOps, three interfaces), not edge cases
  - **Example:** Knowledge check questions test essential decision-making (which interface for which task)
  - **Why:** Reinforces high-impact skills learned in Course 1

- ✅ **Modularity & Composability**
  - **How:** Module 1.4 can stand alone as a recap OR serve as bridge to Course 2
  - **Example:** Students could skip directly to Course 2 (if confident) or use this module for reinforcement
  - **Why:** Respects different learner paces and confidence levels

- ✅ **Bridging Two Worlds**
  - **How:** Recap uses terminology accessible to both cloud-native and networking audiences
  - **Example:** "GitOps workflow" (cloud-native) + "declarative configuration" (networking) = both resonate
  - **Why:** Ensures all students see Course 1 through their own lens

- ✅ **Train for Reality, Not Rote**
  - **How:** Forward map to Course 2 emphasizes real-world workflows (provision → attach → validate → decommission)
  - **Example:** "You'll design VPCs for specific workload requirements" (not "you'll memorize VPC YAML syntax")
  - **Why:** Sets expectation that Course 2 is about operational capability, not trivia

- ✅ **Teach the Why Behind the How**
  - **How:** "Course 1 vs Course 2" section explains WHY exploration came before provisioning
  - **Example:** "Foundation before building" progression is pedagogically intentional
  - **Why:** Students understand the learning path design, which builds trust

- ✅ **Support as Part of Learning**
  - **How:** Motivation section normalizes escalation and collaboration
  - **Example:** "If you're stuck, that's normal—support is part of learning"
  - **Why:** Reduces anxiety about Course 2 challenges, encourages healthy help-seeking

### Target Audience Considerations

#### For Cloud-Native Learners
**What They Bring:**
- Comfortable with Kubernetes, CRDs, GitOps concepts
- Understand declarative desired state models
- Familiar with kubectl commands

**What This Module Reinforces:**
- Kubernetes abstractions apply to network management (not just app deployment)
- GitOps is production-standard for infrastructure (not just applications)
- kubectl skills transfer directly to network operations

**Bridge to Networking:**
- "VPC design considerations" (Module 2.1 preview) introduces network planning concepts
- "VLAN selection" and "subnet sizing" will be new but presented in familiar GitOps context

---

#### For Networking Professionals
**What They Bring:**
- Deep understanding of VLANs, subnets, routing
- Traditional switch CLI experience
- Network design and troubleshooting skills

**What This Module Reinforces:**
- Network concepts (VLANs, subnets) haven't disappeared—just managed differently
- Troubleshooting methodology (Gitea → kubectl → Grafana) parallels traditional approaches (config → status → metrics)
- Their network expertise is valuable for Course 2 design decisions

**Bridge to Cloud-Native:**
- "GitOps workflow" and "reconciliation" will feel more natural after Course 1 practice
- "CRDs as abstractions" concept solidifies (network resources as code)

---

#### Shared Bridge (Both Audiences)
**Common Ground:**
- Both audiences successfully completed Course 1 (shared accomplishment)
- Both understand the three-interface model (universal operational pattern)
- Both are ready to provision VPCs (hands-on work is equalizer)

**Course 2 as Bridge:**
Module 2.1 (VPC design) requires both networking knowledge (subnets) and cloud-native skills (GitOps). This naturally blends both domains.

---

### Common Challenges

#### Challenge 1: "This feels too easy / I expected more"
**Stumbling Block:** High-achieving students may feel Module 1.4 is beneath them

**Mitigation:**
- Frame as intentional pedagogical choice: "Recap modules aren't meant to challenge—they're meant to consolidate"
- Provide optional extension: "If you feel confident, proceed directly to Module 2.1"
- Set expectation: "Course 2 will challenge you—this is your moment to breathe before the push"

---

#### Challenge 2: "I don't feel ready for Course 2"
**Stumbling Block:** Students with lower confidence may feel intimidated by provisioning operations

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize foundation: "Course 1 gave you everything you need for Course 2"
- Point to successes: "You've already created a VPC—Course 2 just builds on that"
- Normalize learning curve: "Course 2 will be challenging, but that's how you grow"
- Offer support: "If you struggle in Course 2, revisit relevant Course 1 modules"

---

#### Challenge 3: "What if I don't remember everything from Course 1?"
**Stumbling Block:** Students worried about retention after module gap

**Mitigation:**
- Knowledge check questions identify gaps: "If you missed questions, review those modules"
- Just-in-time learning: "Course 2 modules will reference Course 1 concepts as needed"
- Reference materials: "You can always revisit Module 1.X designs during Course 2"
- Normalize: "You don't need to memorize—you need to know where to look"

---

### Confidence-Building Opportunities

#### Win 1: "I've completed an entire course!"
**Moment:** Introduction hook acknowledges distance traveled
**Feeling:** Accomplishment, pride, momentum

**Teaching Point:** Course 1 completion is significant (not just "another module"). Celebrate it.

---

#### Win 2: "I can answer these knowledge check questions"
**Moment:** Successfully answering 3-4 knowledge check questions
**Feeling:** Competence, validation of learning

**Teaching Point:** Self-check format reduces pressure while building confidence through correct answers.

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (Must Complete First)
- ✅ Module 1.1: Welcome to Fabric Operations - Establishes operator role, kubectl basics
- ✅ Module 1.2: How Hedgehog Works - Teaches GitOps workflow, three interfaces
- ✅ Module 1.3: Mastering the Three Interfaces - Deep dive on interface usage

**Rationale:** Module 1.4 recaps all of Course 1, so all prior modules must be complete.

---

### Enables (Unlocks These Modules)
- ✅ **Module 2.1: Define VPC Network** - First Course 2 module (VPC design and provisioning)
- ✅ All of Course 2 - Module 1.4 is the gateway to hands-on provisioning operations

**Rationale:** Module 1.4 completes the foundation. Course 2 requires that foundation to be solid.

---

### Related Modules (Complementary, Not Required)
- None - Module 1.4 is a capstone/transition module with no side dependencies

## Notes & Iterations

### Design Decisions

**Decision 1: No Hands-On Lab**
- **Rationale:** Issue #8 explicitly states "No lab component (recap/transition only)"
- **Benefit:** Gives students mental space to reflect before Course 2 intensity
- **Alternative considered:** Optional self-directed review of `myfirst-vpc` (included as suggestion)

---

**Decision 2: Self-Check Questions (Not Graded)**
- **Rationale:** Confidence-building through low-stakes assessment
- **Benefit:** Students assess their own readiness without pressure
- **Format:** Answers provided immediately (no waiting for grading)

---

**Decision 3: Shorter Duration (8-10 min vs 15 min)**
- **Rationale:** Issue #8 specifies "shorter than typical 15-minute module"
- **Benefit:** Respects learner attention for recap content (no new material)
- **Structure:** Focus on key takeaways, not exhaustive review

---

**Decision 4: Equal Emphasis on All Three Modules**
- **Rationale:** Each Course 1 module (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) gets ~30 seconds recap + integration
- **Benefit:** Reinforces that all three are equally important
- **Alternative considered:** Focus more on Module 1.3 (most recent) - rejected because Module 1.2 (GitOps) is more foundational for Course 2

---

**Decision 5: Course 2 Preview Depth**
- **Rationale:** Detailed preview of all 4 Course 2 modules (not just Module 2.1)
- **Benefit:** Reduces anxiety by showing clear progression (known path)
- **Risk:** Could overwhelm (mitigated by keeping each preview to ~30 seconds)

---

**Decision 6: Confidence-Building Tone**
- **Rationale:** Issue #8 emphasizes "confidence-building tone throughout"
- **Implementation:** "You've accomplished X" statements, not "you still need to learn Y"
- **Examples:** "You're a confident beginner" (not "you're not an expert yet")

---

### Anticipated Iteration Needs

- ⏳ Course lead may adjust timing allocation (more/less preview vs recap)
- ⏳ Knowledge check questions may need rephrasing for clarity
- ⏳ Motivation section tone may need adjustment (too encouraging vs realistic)
- ⏳ Course 2 preview may need updating if Module 2.X designs change

---
