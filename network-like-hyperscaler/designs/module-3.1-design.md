## Content Outline

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Hook: From Provisioning to Observing**

> In Course 2, you became proficient at provisioning VPCs, attaching servers, and validating connectivity. You created resources and verified they worked.
>
> But in production operations, provisioning is just the beginning. The real question becomes:
> - **Is my fabric healthy right now?**
> - **How much traffic is flowing through each interface?**
> - **Are my switches experiencing errors?**
> - **Is my network performing as expected?**
>
> This is where **observability** comes in—the ability to see what's happening inside your fabric over time.

**Context: Course 3 Shift**

Course 2 was about **creating resources** (VPCs, attachments, validation).

Course 3 is about **observing resources** (metrics, health, trends, diagnostics).

**What You'll Learn:**

- How Hedgehog collects telemetry from switches
- The path metrics take from switch to dashboard
- Different types of metrics (counters vs gauges)
- How to query raw metrics in Prometheus
- How long metrics are retained and why

You'll access the Prometheus UI directly and run queries to see the raw metrics that power Grafana dashboards.

**The Observability Stack:**

Hedgehog uses the **LGTM stack** (Loki + Grafana + Tempo + Mimir):
- **Prometheus**: Time-series metrics database
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Loki**: Log aggregation
- **Alloy**: Telemetry collector (runs on switches)

In your lab environment, these tools run in the External Management K3s Cluster (EMKC) alongside ArgoCD and Gitea.

```

**Components Explained:**

1. **Alloy Agents** (on each switch)
   - Grafana's telemetry collector
   - Scrapes Fabric Agent metrics every 120 seconds
   - Scrapes Node Exporter metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Collects syslog for log aggregation
   - Configured via `defaultAlloyConfig` in Fabricator

2. **fabric-proxy** (control node)
   - Receives metrics from all Alloy agents
   - Forwards to Prometheus via Remote Write protocol
   - Runs as a service on port 31028
   - Single aggregation point for all switch telemetry

3. **Prometheus** (EMKC)
   - Time-series database for metrics
   - Stores data with timestamps
   - Provides PromQL query language
   - Retention: 15 days by default (configurable)

4. **Grafana** (EMKC)
   - Queries Prometheus for data
   - Renders visualizations and dashboards
   - Provides 6 pre-built Hedgehog dashboards
   - Web UI: http://localhost:3000

**Key Insight:** Metrics start on switches, flow through fabric-proxy, land in Prometheus, and are visualized in Grafana. Understanding this flow helps troubleshoot when metrics are missing.

#### Concept 2: Metric Sources

**Where Do Metrics Come From?**

Hedgehog collects metrics from four primary sources:

**1. Fabric Agent (Switch Metrics)**

The Fabric Agent runs on each SONiC switch and provides:
- **BGP metrics**: Neighbor status (up/down), prefixes received/sent
- **Interface metrics**: Packet counters, byte counters, error rates, operational state
- **ASIC critical resources**: Route table usage, ARP table size, ACL capacity
- **Platform metrics**: PSU voltage, fan speeds, temperature sensors

**2. Node Exporter (System Metrics)**

Linux system metrics from each switch:
- **CPU**: Utilization (user, system, idle, iowait), load average
- **Memory**: Total/available/free, swap usage
- **Disk**: Space used/available, I/O operations
- **Network**: Interface traffic (all ports), connection states

**3. Fabric Controller (Control Plane Metrics)**

Kubernetes controller metrics:
- CRD reconciliation status
- VPC allocation counts
- Controller health and performance
- API request latencies

**4. DHCP Server (Network Services Metrics)**

DHCP service metrics:
- Lease counts per VPC subnet
- Pool utilization percentage
- DHCP request/response rates
- Lease expiration tracking

**Metric Access Pattern:**

- Fabric Agent: Exposed on switch, scraped by Alloy
- Node Exporter: Built into SONiC OS, scraped by Alloy
- Controller: Exposes metrics on control plane, scraped directly by Prometheus
- DHCP: Metrics available via controller

---

#### Concept 3: Metric Types

**Understanding Counters vs Gauges**

Prometheus uses different metric types for different data:

**Counters (Monotonically Increasing)**

- **Definition**: Values that only go up (never decrease)
- **Reset**: Only reset to 0 when system restarts
- **Examples**:
  - Bytes transmitted on interface (keeps counting up)
  - Total BGP updates received (cumulative)
  - Packet errors (total count)

**Counter Example:**
```
interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"} 1523456789
interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"} 1523789012  # 2 minutes later
interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"} 1524123456  # 2 minutes later
```

**Using Counters:**
- Raw counter values aren't directly useful (just big numbers)
- Use `rate()` function to calculate per-second rates
- Example: `rate(interface_bytes_out[5m])` = bytes per second over last 5 minutes

**Gauges (Point-in-Time Values)**

- **Definition**: Values that can go up or down
- **Fluctuate**: Represent current state at moment of scrape
- **Examples**:
  - CPU percentage (0-100%)
  - Interface operational state (up=1, down=0)
  - BGP neighbor count (can increase or decrease)
  - Temperature in Celsius (varies with load)

**Gauge Example:**
```
cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"} 23.5
cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"} 45.2  # 2 minutes later (CPU spike)
cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"} 18.7  # 2 minutes later (CPU normalized)
```

**Using Gauges:**
- Values are directly meaningful
- Can use directly in dashboards
- Can set alerts on thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%)

**Histograms (Distribution of Values)**

- **Definition**: Buckets of observations (less common in Hedgehog)
- **Examples**: Request latencies, response times
- **Use Case**: Understanding distribution, not just average

**Why This Matters:**

Choosing the right PromQL function depends on metric type:
- `rate()` or `irate()` for counters (calculate change rate)
- Direct value or `avg()` for gauges
- `histogram_quantile()` for histograms

---

#### Concept 4: Introduction to PromQL

**Prometheus Query Language Basics**

PromQL is the query language for Prometheus, similar to SQL for databases.

**Basic Query Patterns:**

**1. Select a metric:**
```promql
# Get CPU usage for all switches
cpu_usage_percent
```

**2. Filter by labels:**
```promql
# Get CPU usage for specific switch
cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"}

# Get interface bytes for specific interface
interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01", interface="Ethernet1"}
```

**3. Calculate rates (for counters):**
```promql
# Bytes per second transmitted over last 5 minutes
rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01", interface="Ethernet1"}[5m])
```

**4. Aggregate across labels:**
```promql
# Total bytes per second across all interfaces on leaf-01
sum(rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01"}[5m]))

# Average CPU across all switches
avg(cpu_usage_percent)

# Maximum temperature across all sensors
max(temperature_celsius)
```

**5. Arithmetic operations:**
```promql
# Convert bytes/sec to bits/sec
rate(interface_bytes_out[5m]) * 8

# Calculate percentage
(memory_used / memory_total) * 100
```

**Common Functions:**

- `rate()`: Per-second average rate over time range
- `irate()`: Instant rate (last 2 data points)
- `sum()`: Add values across dimensions
- `avg()`: Average values
- `max()` / `min()`: Maximum/minimum values
- `count()`: Count number of time series

**Time Ranges:**

- `[5m]`: Last 5 minutes
- `[1h]`: Last 1 hour
- `[24h]`: Last 24 hours

**Example Queries You'll Use:**

```promql
# BGP neighbors that are down
bgp_neighbor_state{state!="established"}

# Interface error rate
rate(interface_errors_in[5m])

# Switches with high CPU
cpu_usage_percent > 80

# Total VPCs in fabric
count(kube_vpc_info)
```

**Pro Tip:** Start simple, add complexity incrementally. Test in Prometheus UI before using in Grafana dashboards.

#### Concept 5: Data Retention and Aggregation

**How Long Are Metrics Stored?**

**Default Retention: 15 days**

Prometheus stores all metrics for 15 days by default in your environment. After 15 days, data is automatically deleted to manage disk space.

**Why 15 Days?**

- Sufficient for troubleshooting recent issues
- Balances storage cost with usefulness
- Captures weekly patterns (7 days × 2)
- Allows historical comparison

**What Happens After 15 Days?**

- Metrics are deleted (no long-term storage by default)
- For long-term retention, use Mimir (Prometheus long-term storage)
- Grafana dashboards will show "No Data" for queries beyond retention

**Scrape Interval: 120 seconds (2 minutes)**

- Alloy scrapes metrics every 2 minutes
- This is the resolution of your data
- You cannot see changes faster than 2 minutes
- Reduces switch CPU load compared to 1-second scraping

**Data Resolution Trade-offs:**

- **Faster scraping (e.g., 30 sec)**: Higher resolution, more disk space, more switch CPU
- **Slower scraping (e.g., 5 min)**: Lower resolution, less disk space, less switch CPU
- **Hedgehog default (2 min)**: Balanced for typical network monitoring

**Storage Calculations:**

Approximate storage per switch:
- ~100 metrics per switch
- 120-second interval = 30 samples per hour
- 30 samples × 24 hours × 15 days = 10,800 samples per metric
- Total: ~1 million data points per switch (minimal disk usage)

**Retention Configuration:**

Retention is set in Prometheus deployment:
```yaml
# Prometheus values.yaml
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    retention: 15d  # 15 days
    retentionSize: 10GB  # Or size limit
```

**Querying Across Time:**

```promql
# Last 5 minutes (always available)
rate(interface_bytes_out[5m])

# Last 7 days (within retention)
rate(interface_bytes_out[7d])

# Last 30 days (ERROR - exceeds retention)
rate(interface_bytes_out[30d])  # Returns no data
```

**Best Practice:** For long-term capacity planning, export Grafana dashboard snapshots monthly or configure Mimir for extended retention.

### Hands-On Lab (4-5 minutes)

**Lab Title:** Explore Fabric Telemetry in Prometheus

**Scenario:**

You've been operating Hedgehog Fabric for several weeks. VPCs are provisioned, servers are attached, and traffic is flowing. Now you want to understand the telemetry system that monitors your fabric.

**Environment Access:**

- **Prometheus:** http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000 (we'll use in Module 3.2)
- **kubectl:** Already configured

---

#### Task 1: Access Prometheus UI (1 minute)

**Objective:** Navigate to Prometheus and understand the interface

**Steps:**

1. **Open Prometheus in your browser:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:9090
   - You should see the Prometheus query interface

2. **Explore the UI sections:**
   - **Graph tab**: Query and visualize metrics
   - **Alerts tab**: Active alerts (if configured)
   - **Status dropdown**:
     - Targets: View scrape targets (switches)
     - Configuration: Prometheus config
     - Service Discovery: How Prometheus finds targets

3. **Check scrape targets:**
   - Click **Status → Targets**
   - Look for fabric-proxy and other Hedgehog targets
   - Verify state = "UP" (healthy scraping)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Prometheus UI loads
- ✅ Targets page shows fabric-related endpoints
- ✅ All targets show state = UP

---

#### Task 2: Query Switch Metrics (2 minutes)

**Objective:** Run basic PromQL queries to explore switch metrics

**Steps:**

1. **Query CPU usage for all switches:**

   In the Prometheus query box, enter:
   ```promql
   cpu_usage_percent
   ```

   Click **Execute**

   **Expected result:** List of switches with CPU percentages:
   ```
   cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"} 18.5
   cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-02"} 22.3
   cpu_usage_percent{switch="spine-01"} 12.1
   ...
   ```

   Click **Graph** tab to see time series visualization

2. **Query CPU for a specific switch:**
   ```promql
   cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"}
   ```

   **Expected result:** Single time series for leaf-01

3. **Query interface byte counters:**
   ```promql
   interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01"}
   ```

   **Expected result:** Counter values for all interfaces on leaf-01:
   ```
   interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"} 152345678901
   interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet2"} 98234567890
   ...
   ```

   **Note:** These are counters (large numbers that keep increasing)

4. **Calculate bandwidth utilization:**
   ```promql
   rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[5m]) * 8
   ```

   **Expected result:** Bits per second over last 5 minutes:
   ```
   {switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"} 125600000  # ~125 Mbps
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `rate([5m])` calculates bytes/sec over 5 minutes
   - `* 8` converts bytes to bits
   - Result is bandwidth in bits per second

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ CPU metrics display for all switches
- ✅ Interface counters visible
- ✅ Bandwidth calculation returns reasonable values

---

#### Task 3: Explore BGP Metrics (1-2 minutes)

**Objective:** Query BGP neighbor status to verify fabric underlay

**Steps:**

1. **Query all BGP neighbors:**
   ```promql
   bgp_neighbor_state
   ```

   **Expected result:** BGP neighbors with state labels:
   ```
   bgp_neighbor_state{switch="leaf-01",neighbor="172.30.128.1",state="established"} 1
   bgp_neighbor_state{switch="leaf-01",neighbor="172.30.128.2",state="established"} 1
   ...
   ```

2. **Filter for non-established neighbors (find problems):**
   ```promql
   bgp_neighbor_state{state!="established"}
   ```

   **Expected result:** Empty (all neighbors healthy) or list of down neighbors

3. **Count total BGP sessions:**
   ```promql
   count(bgp_neighbor_state)
   ```

   **Expected result:** Total number of BGP sessions in fabric (e.g., 40)

4. **Count established BGP sessions:**
   ```promql
   count(bgp_neighbor_state{state="established"})
   ```

   **Expected result:** Should match total (if fabric is healthy)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ BGP metrics visible
- ✅ All (or most) neighbors show state="established"
- ✅ Count queries return expected numbers

---

#### Task 4: Understand Metric Labels (1 minute)

**Objective:** Learn how labels identify specific metrics

**Steps:**

1. **Query metrics with multiple labels:**
   ```promql
   interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
   ```

   **Observe labels:**
   - `switch="leaf-01"` - Which switch
   - `interface="Ethernet1"` - Which interface

2. **Query with partial label matching:**
   ```promql
   interface_bytes_out{switch=~"leaf-.*"}
   ```

   **Explanation:** `=~` means "matches regex", `leaf-.*` matches all leaf switches

3. **List all unique switches in metrics:**
   ```promql
   count by (switch) (cpu_usage_percent)
   ```

   **Expected result:** One entry per switch

**Key Insight:** Labels allow you to filter and aggregate metrics. Every metric has labels like `switch`, `interface`, `neighbor`, etc.

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Understand how labels filter metrics
- ✅ Can query specific switch or interface
- ✅ See how regex matching works

---

### Wrap-Up & Assessment (2 minutes)

**What You Accomplished:**

You explored the Hedgehog telemetry architecture and:
- ✅ Accessed Prometheus UI and verified scrape targets
- ✅ Queried switch CPU and interface metrics
- ✅ Examined BGP neighbor status
- ✅ Calculated bandwidth utilization using PromQL
- ✅ Understood metric labels and filtering

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Telemetry flows**: Switch Alloy agents → fabric-proxy → Prometheus → Grafana
2. **Metric types matter**: Counters (use `rate()`) vs Gauges (use directly)
3. **PromQL is powerful**: Filter, aggregate, and calculate from raw metrics
4. **Labels enable filtering**: Query specific switches, interfaces, or neighbors
5. **Retention is limited**: 15 days by default, plan for long-term storage if needed

**Next Module Preview:**

Module 3.2: Dashboard Interpretation - Now that you understand the raw metrics, you'll learn to interpret the 6 pre-built Grafana dashboards that visualize this data for daily operations.

### Assessment Questions

#### Question 1: Telemetry Flow

**Scenario:** You notice that metrics for leaf-02 stopped appearing in Grafana 10 minutes ago, but the switch is still operational. What is the most likely point of failure in the telemetry pipeline?

- A) Prometheus is down
- B) Grafana is down
- C) Alloy agent on leaf-02 stopped scraping
- D) fabric-proxy is down

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** C) Alloy agent on leaf-02 stopped scraping

**Explanation:**
- If **Prometheus** were down, ALL switches would lose metrics (not just leaf-02)
- If **Grafana** were down, you wouldn't see ANY dashboards (but Prometheus would still have data)
- If **fabric-proxy** were down, ALL switches would lose metrics (it's the single aggregation point)
- If **Alloy agent on leaf-02** stopped, only leaf-02 metrics would be missing

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Check Prometheus Targets page: `http://localhost:9090/targets`
2. Look for leaf-02 endpoint
3. If state = DOWN, Alloy agent on leaf-02 is likely the issue
4. SSH to leaf-02 and check Alloy service: `systemctl status alloy`

#### Question 2: Metric Types

**Scenario:** You want to calculate the average bandwidth utilization for interface Ethernet1 on leaf-01 over the last hour. Which PromQL query is correct?

- A) `interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}`
- B) `rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[1h])`
- C) `avg(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"})`
- D) `sum(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[1h])`

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) `rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[1h])`

**Explanation:**

`interface_bytes_out` is a **counter** (monotonically increasing byte count). To get bandwidth:

- **Option A** returns the raw counter value (e.g., 152345678901 bytes) - not useful for bandwidth
- **Option B** calculates bytes per second over 1 hour using `rate()` - **CORRECT**
- **Option C** `avg()` doesn't make sense on a counter (averaging total bytes over time is meaningless)
- **Option D** `sum()` isn't a valid function with a time range (syntax error)

**Complete query for bits per second:**
```promql
rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[1h]) * 8
```

**Rule:** Always use `rate()` or `irate()` on counters to get meaningful rates.

---

#### Question 3: PromQL Filtering

**Scenario:** You want to find all interfaces across all switches that have error rates above 100 errors per second. Which query should you use?

- A) `interface_errors_in > 100`
- B) `rate(interface_errors_in[5m]) > 100`
- C) `count(interface_errors_in{errors > 100})`
- D) `sum(interface_errors_in) > 100`

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) `rate(interface_errors_in[5m]) > 100`

**Explanation:**

`interface_errors_in` is a **counter** (total errors since switch boot).

- **Option A**: Compares raw counter to 100 (wrong - counters grow to millions)
- **Option B**: Calculates error rate (errors/sec) over 5 min, then filters > 100 - **CORRECT**
- **Option C**: Syntax error - can't filter labels with `errors > 100`
- **Option D**: Sums all error counters (not per-interface, not a rate)

**Query Breakdown:**
```promql
rate(interface_errors_in[5m])      # Errors per second, all interfaces
> 100                               # Filter to only interfaces with > 100 err/sec
```

**Result:** List of interfaces with high error rates:
```
{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet5"} 145.2
{switch="leaf-03",interface="Ethernet2"} 203.7
```

#### Question 4: Data Retention

**Scenario:** You're investigating a VPC connectivity issue that a user reported 20 days ago. You want to check interface metrics from the day of the incident. What will happen when you query Prometheus?

- A) Prometheus will return metrics from 20 days ago
- B) Prometheus will return "No Data" (retention limit exceeded)
- C) Prometheus will return partial data (10 days available)
- D) Prometheus will automatically fetch from Grafana Cloud long-term storage

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) Prometheus will return "No Data" (retention limit exceeded)

**Explanation:**

Default Prometheus retention is **15 days**. Metrics older than 15 days are automatically deleted.

- **Option A**: Incorrect - data older than 15 days is deleted
- **Option B**: **CORRECT** - 20 days exceeds retention, no data available
- **Option C**: Incorrect - Prometheus doesn't keep "partial" old data
- **Option D**: Incorrect - Prometheus doesn't auto-fetch from external storage

**Solutions for Long-Term Storage:**

1. **Grafana Cloud**: Configure Prometheus remote write to Grafana Cloud (unlimited retention)
2. **Mimir**: Deploy Mimir for long-term Prometheus-compatible storage
3. **Export Snapshots**: Regularly export Grafana dashboard snapshots
4. **Increase Retention**: Change Prometheus `retention` setting (requires more disk)

**Best Practice:**
- 15 days is sufficient for recent troubleshooting
- For compliance or long-term analysis, configure Mimir or cloud storage
- Export incident-related dashboards to PDF/PNG for documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Prometheus Access

**Prometheus UI:**
- **URL:** http://localhost:9090
- **Authentication:** None (in lab environment)
- **Key Pages:**
  - **Graph:** Query and visualize metrics
  - **Status → Targets:** View scrape endpoints
  - **Status → Configuration:** View Prometheus config

**Prometheus API:**
```bash
# Query via API
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=cpu_usage_percent'

# Query range (time series)
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query_range?query=cpu_usage_percent&start=2025-10-16T10:00:00Z&end=2025-10-16T11:00:00Z&step=120s'
```

### Key Metrics Reference

**Switch CPU:**
```promql
cpu_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"}
```

**Interface Counters:**
```promql
interface_bytes_in{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
interface_packets_in{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
interface_packets_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
interface_errors_in{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
interface_errors_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}
```

**Interface Bandwidth (calculated):**
```promql
# Bytes per second (5 min average)
rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[5m])

# Bits per second
rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[5m]) * 8

# Megabits per second
rate(interface_bytes_out{switch="leaf-01",interface="Ethernet1"}[5m]) * 8 / 1000000
```

**BGP Metrics:**
```promql
bgp_neighbor_state{switch="leaf-01",neighbor="172.30.128.1"}
bgp_prefixes_received{switch="leaf-01",neighbor="172.30.128.1"}
bgp_prefixes_sent{switch="leaf-01",neighbor="172.30.128.1"}
```

**Memory:**
```promql
memory_usage_percent{switch="leaf-01"}
memory_total_bytes{switch="leaf-01"}
memory_available_bytes{switch="leaf-01"}
```

**Temperature:**

temperature_celsius{switch="leaf-01",sensor="cpu"}
temperature_celsius{switch="leaf-01",sensor="asic"}
```

### PromQL Cheat Sheet

**Basic Selectors:**
```promql
metric_name                          # All time series for this metric
metric_name{label="value"}          # Filter by exact label match
metric_name{label=~"regex"}         # Filter by regex match
metric_name{label!="value"}         # Exclude label value
```

**Time Ranges:**
```promql
metric_name[5m]    # Last 5 minutes
metric_name[1h]    # Last 1 hour
metric_name[1d]    # Last 1 day
```

**Rate Functions:**
```promql
rate(counter[5m])      # Average rate over 5 min
irate(counter[5m])     # Instant rate (last 2 points)
```

**Aggregation:**
```promql
sum(metric)                        # Sum across all labels
avg(metric)                        # Average
max(metric) / min(metric)          # Maximum / Minimum
count(metric)                      # Count time series
sum by (switch) (metric)           # Sum per switch
avg by (switch,interface) (metric) # Average per switch+interface
```

**Arithmetic:**
```promql
metric * 8             # Multiply (e.g., bytes to bits)
metric / 1000000       # Divide (e.g., to megabytes)
metric_a + metric_b    # Add metrics
```

**Comparison:**
```promql
metric > 100           # Greater than
metric < 50            # Less than
metric == 1            # Equals (exact)
```

## Pedagogical Design

### Learning Philosophy Principles Emphasized

#### 1. **Teach the Why Behind the How** ⭐
- **How:** Explains telemetry architecture from switch to dashboard
- **Example:** Why counters need `rate()` vs gauges used directly
- **Why:** Understanding data flow enables troubleshooting missing metrics

#### 2. **Confidence Before Comprehensiveness** ⭐
- **How:** Starts with simple queries (CPU), builds to complex (bandwidth calculations)
- **Example:** Task 2 progression: single metric → filtered → calculated rate
- **Why:** Early wins with basic queries before advanced PromQL

#### 3. **Focus on What Matters Most** ⭐
- **How:** Focuses on metrics operators check daily (CPU, bandwidth, BGP)
- **Example:** BGP neighbor status (critical for fabric health)
- **Why:** Prepares for real-world monitoring tasks

#### 4. **Learn by Doing, Not Watching** ⭐
- **How:** Hands-on Prometheus queries with immediate results
- **Example:** Students run queries and see metric values
- **Why:** Active learning reinforces PromQL syntax

#### 5. **Abstraction as Empowerment** ⭐
- **How:** Prometheus abstracts metric collection complexity
- **Example:** Single query returns metrics from all switches
- **Why:** Demonstrates power of centralized observability

#### 6. **Bridging Two Worlds**
- **How:** Networking concepts (BGP, interfaces) in observability context
- **Example:** PromQL for network metrics (relatable to both audiences)
- **Why:** Accessible to cloud-native (PromQL) and networking (BGP) professionals

---

### Target Audience Considerations

#### For Cloud-Native Learners

**What They Bring:**
- Familiarity with metrics and monitoring
- Possible Prometheus experience
- Kubernetes observability concepts

**What's New:**
- Network-specific metrics (BGP, interfaces, switch resources)
- Hardware metrics (PSU, temperature, fans)

**Bridge Strategy:**
- Relate Prometheus to Kubernetes monitoring (familiar)
- Frame switch metrics like pod metrics (CPU, memory)
- Emphasize PromQL (transferable skill)

#### For Networking Professionals

**What They Bring:**
- Deep understanding of BGP, interfaces, switch resources
- SNMP monitoring experience

**What's New:**
- Prometheus and PromQL (vs SNMP)
- Time-series database concepts
- Pull-based metrics (vs SNMP traps)

**Bridge Strategy:**
- Compare Prometheus to SNMP MIBs (similar concepts, modern approach)
- Show how counters map to SNMP interface counters
- Frame PromQL as "better than SNMP walks"

---

### Common Challenges and Mitigation

#### Challenge 1: PromQL Syntax Confusion

**Stumbling Block:** Students unfamiliar with PromQL syntax

**Symptoms:**
- Syntax errors in queries
- Confusion about when to use `rate()`
- Label selector mistakes

**Mitigation:**
- Provide PromQL cheat sheet in content
- Task 2 walks through queries step-by-step
- Assessment questions test query construction
- Lab provides working examples to modify

---

#### Challenge 2: Counter vs Gauge Confusion

**Stumbling Block:** Students use counters incorrectly (without `rate()`)

**Symptoms:**
- Querying raw counter values (meaningless large numbers)
- Not understanding why bandwidth needs calculation
- Applying `rate()` to gauges (incorrect)

**Mitigation:**
- Concept 3 explicitly explains counter vs gauge
- Visual examples of counter growth over time
- Assessment Question 2 tests counter understanding
- Lab Task 2.4 demonstrates rate calculation

---

#### Challenge 3: Retention Expectations

**Stumbling Block:** Students expect unlimited historical data

**Symptoms:**
- Trying to query data older than 15 days
- Surprise when metrics disappear
- Not understanding storage trade-offs

**Mitigation:**
- Concept 5 clearly states 15-day retention
- Explains why retention is limited (storage cost)
- Assessment Question 4 tests retention understanding
- Provides alternatives (Mimir, Grafana Cloud)
