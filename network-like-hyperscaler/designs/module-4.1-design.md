## Content Outline

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Hook: When Things Go Wrong**

> You've designed VPCs, attached servers, validated connectivity, and monitored fabric health. Your Hedgehog fabric is operational.
>
> Then one morning: **"Server-07 can't reach the database. The application is down."**
>
> You could panic. Or you could apply **systematic troubleshooting methodology**—the difference between experienced operators and beginners.
>
> Beginners randomly check things, hoping to stumble on the issue. Experts use **hypothesis-driven investigation**, eliminating possibilities systematically until they identify the root cause.

**Context: Troubleshooting as a Skill**

Module 3.4 taught you the **pre-escalation diagnostic checklist**—collecting evidence for support tickets.

Module 4.1 teaches you **how to diagnose issues independently** using that evidence:
- Form hypotheses based on symptoms
- Test hypotheses with kubectl and Grafana
- Eliminate possibilities systematically
- Identify root cause with confidence

**What You'll Learn:**

- Systematic troubleshooting methodology (hypothesis-driven)
- Common failure modes:
  * VPC attachment issues (incorrect subnet/connection/VLAN)
  * BGP peering problems (Agent CRD state)
  * Interface errors (Grafana Interface Dashboard)
  * Configuration drift (GitOps reconciliation failures)
- Diagnostic workflow: Events → Agent CRDs → Grafana metrics → Logs
- Decision trees for common scenarios

**Scenario for This Module:**

You'll diagnose a real connectivity failure: **A VPCAttachment was created successfully (no errors in events), but the server cannot communicate within the VPC.**

Classic troubleshooting challenge: Configuration looks correct, system reports success, but it doesn't work.

### Core Concepts (5-6 minutes)

#### Concept 1: Troubleshooting Methodology (Hypothesis-Driven Investigation)

**The Problem with Random Checking:**

Beginners troubleshoot by checking things randomly:
- "Let me check the controller logs"
- "Maybe it's a BGP issue"
- "Did the switch reboot?"
- "Is DNS working?"

This wastes time and misses systematic patterns.

---

**Systematic Approach: Hypothesis-Driven Investigation**

**Step 1: Gather Symptoms**
- What is not working? (Specific behavior)
- What is the expected behavior?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?

**Step 2: Form Hypotheses**

Based on symptoms, generate possible causes:
- Configuration error (VLAN mismatch, wrong connection)
- Connectivity issue (BGP down, interface down)
- Platform issue (switch failure, resource exhaustion)

**Step 3: Test Hypotheses**

For each hypothesis, design a test:
- If VLAN mismatch → Check Agent CRD interface config
- If BGP down → Check Agent CRD bgpNeighbors state
- If interface down → Check Grafana Interface Dashboard

**Step 4: Eliminate or Confirm**

Each test either:
- **Eliminates** hypothesis (BGP is up → not a BGP issue)
- **Confirms** hypothesis (VLAN 1010 expected, VLAN 1020 configured → VLAN mismatch!)

**Step 5: Identify Root Cause**

When one hypothesis is confirmed and others eliminated:
- Root cause identified
- Solution becomes clear

---

**Example: "Server-07 can't ping gateway"**

**Symptoms:**
- Server-07 in VPC webapp-vpc, subnet frontend
- Expected: ping 10.0.10.1 (gateway)
- Actual: "Destination Host Unreachable"
- Recent change: VPCAttachment created today

**Hypotheses:**
1. VLAN not configured on switch interface (configuration)
2. Interface is down (connectivity)
3. Server network interface misconfigured (server issue)
4. BGP session down (routing issue)

**Tests:**
1. Check Agent CRD for leaf-04 (server-07 connects to leaf-04): Is VLAN 1010 on Ethernet8?
2. Check Grafana Interface Dashboard: Is leaf-04/Ethernet8 oper=up?
3. SSH to server-07: Is enp2s1.1010 interface up and tagged?
4. Check Agent CRD bgpNeighbors: Are all BGP sessions established?

**Results:**
1. Agent CRD shows VLAN 1010 on Ethernet8 ✅
2. Grafana shows Ethernet8 oper=up ✅
3. Server interface enp2s1.1010 is up and tagged ✅
4. BGP sessions all established ✅

**Wait—all tests passed, but still broken?**

**Revised Hypothesis:** VPCAttachment references **wrong connection**.

**Test:** Check VPCAttachment spec:
```bash
kubectl get vpcattachment webapp-vpc-server-07 -o jsonpath='{.spec.connection}'
# Output: server-07--unbundled--leaf-05
```

**Root Cause Found:** VPCAttachment references `leaf-05` but server-07 actually connects to `leaf-04`.

**Solution:** Fix VPCAttachment connection reference in Gitea, commit.

---

#### Concept 2: Common Failure Modes

**Failure Mode 1: VPC Attachment Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- VPCAttachment created, no error events
- Server cannot communicate within VPC

**Common Root Causes:**
1. **Wrong connection name** - VPCAttachment references incorrect Connection CRD
2. **Wrong subnet** - VPCAttachment references non-existent subnet
3. **VLAN conflict** - Chosen VLAN already in use
4. **nativeVLAN mismatch** - Server expects untagged, VPCAttachment uses tagged

**Diagnostic Path:**
```
Check VPCAttachment spec
  ↓
Verify connection exists: kubectl get connection <name> -n fab
  ↓
Verify subnet exists in VPC: kubectl get vpc <vpc> -o yaml | grep <subnet>
  ↓
Check Agent CRD for switch interface: Is VLAN configured?
  ↓
Check Grafana Interface Dashboard: Is interface up?
```

---

**Failure Mode 2: BGP Peering Problems**

**Symptoms:**
- Cross-VPC connectivity fails (VPCPeering exists)
- External connectivity fails (ExternalPeering exists)
- Grafana Fabric Dashboard shows BGP sessions down

**Common Root Causes:**
1. **BGP session not established** - Neighbor unreachable or misconfigured
2. **Route not advertised** - Permit list misconfiguration
3. **Community mismatch** - External community filter blocks routes

**Diagnostic Path:**
```
Check Grafana Fabric Dashboard: Which BGP sessions down?
  ↓
Check Agent CRD bgpNeighbors for affected switch
  ↓
Identify neighbor IP and state (idle, active, established)
  ↓
If state != established:
  - Check ExternalAttachment neighbor IP/ASN
  - Check switch interface IP configured correctly
  - Check external router reachability
```

---

**Failure Mode 3: Interface Errors**

**Symptoms:**
- Intermittent connectivity failures
- Packet loss
- Grafana shows interface errors

**Common Root Causes:**
1. **Physical layer issue** - Bad cable, SFP, or port
2. **MTU mismatch** - Server/switch MTU configured differently
3. **Congestion** - Traffic exceeds interface capacity
4. **Configuration error** - Speed/duplex mismatch

**Diagnostic Path:**
```
Check Grafana Interface Dashboard: Which interface has errors?
  ↓
Check Agent CRD interface counters: ine (input errors), oute (output errors)
  ↓
Check interface speed and MTU configuration
  ↓
Check physical layer: SFP status, cable integrity
  ↓
If congestion: Check traffic patterns in Grafana
```

---

**Failure Mode 4: Configuration Drift (GitOps Reconciliation Failures)**

**Symptoms:**
- Git shows correct configuration
- kubectl shows different configuration
- ArgoCD shows "OutOfSync"

**Common Root Causes:**
1. **Manual kubectl changes** - Someone applied changes directly (bypassing Git)
2. **ArgoCD sync disabled** - Auto-sync turned off
3. **Git webhook broken** - ArgoCD not notified of commits
4. **Reconciliation error** - Controller failed to apply configuration

**Diagnostic Path:**
```
Check ArgoCD application status: Synced or OutOfSync?
  ↓
Compare Git YAML to kubectl get <resource> -o yaml
  ↓
Check ArgoCD sync history: Last successful sync?
  ↓
Check controller logs for reconciliation errors
  ↓
Check kubectl events for VPC/VPCAttachment errors
```

---

#### Concept 3: Diagnostic Workflow (Evidence Collection Order)

**When facing an issue, collect evidence in this order:**

**Layer 1: Kubernetes Events (Fastest Check)**

```bash
# Check for recent Warning events
kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check events for specific resource
kubectl describe vpc webapp-vpc
kubectl describe vpcattachment webapp-vpc-server-07
```

**Why first?** Events quickly reveal configuration errors, validation failures, and reconciliation issues.

**Look for:**
- VLANConflict, SubnetOverlap (configuration errors)
- DependencyMissing (VPC/Connection not found)
- ReconcileFailed (controller errors)

---

**Layer 2: Agent CRD Status (Detailed Switch State)**

```bash
# Check agent readiness
kubectl get agents -n fab

# View detailed switch state
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o yaml

# Check BGP neighbors
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.bgpNeighbors}' | jq

# Check interface state
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces.Ethernet8}' | jq
```

**Why second?** Agent CRD is source of truth for switch configuration and operational state.

**Look for:**
- BGP neighbor state (established vs idle/active)
- Interface oper state (up vs down)
- VLAN configuration on interfaces
- Platform health (PSU, fan, temperature)

---

**Layer 3: Grafana Dashboards (Visual Metrics)**

**Fabric Dashboard:**
- BGP session health (all established?)
- VPC count (as expected?)

**Interfaces Dashboard:**
- Interface operational state (up/down)
- Error rates (input errors, output errors)
- Traffic patterns (bandwidth utilization)

**Logs Dashboard:**
- Recent ERROR logs (switch or controller)
- Filter by switch name for targeted investigation

**Why third?** Grafana provides visual trends and historical context (not just current state).

**Look for:**
- Interfaces with high error rates
- BGP sessions flapping (up/down repeatedly)
- Traffic patterns indicating congestion or no traffic

---

**Layer 4: Controller Logs (Reconciliation Details)**

```bash
# Check controller logs for resource
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager | grep webapp-vpc-server-07

# Check for errors
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=200 | grep -i error
```

**Why fourth?** Controller logs explain *why* reconciliation succeeded or failed.

**Look for:**
- Reconciliation loops (same resource reconciling repeatedly)
- Errors during configuration application
- Validation failures

---

#### Concept 4: Decision Trees for Common Scenarios

**Decision Tree 1: Server Cannot Communicate in VPC**

```
Server cannot ping gateway or other servers in VPC
  │
  ├─ Check kubectl events for VPCAttachment
  │    │
  │    ├─ Warning events present?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Read error message, fix configuration

  │    │
  ├─ Check Agent CRD for switch
  │    │
  │    ├─ Is interface oper=up?
  │    │    ├─ NO → Physical layer issue (cable, SFP)
  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  │    ├─ Is VLAN configured on interface?

  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check server network interface

  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check Grafana Interface Dashboard
  │    │
  │    ├─ High error rates on interface?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Physical layer issue or MTU mismatch
  │    │    └─ NO → Escalate (unexpected issue)
```

---

**Decision Tree 2: Cross-VPC Connectivity Fails (VPCPeering Exists)**

```
Server in VPC-1 cannot reach server in VPC-2
  │
  ├─ Check kubectl events for VPCPeering
  │    │
  │    ├─ Warning events?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Configuration error in permit list
  │    │    └─ NO → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Verify VPCPeering permit includes both subnets
  │    │
  │    ├─ Permit list missing subnet?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Add subnet to permit list
  │    │    └─ NO → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check both VPCs in same IPv4Namespace
  │    │
  │    ├─ Different namespaces?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Configuration error (VPCPeering requires same namespace)
  │    │    └─ NO → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check BGP sessions in Grafana Fabric Dashboard
  │    │
  │    ├─ BGP sessions down?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Investigate BGP issue (Agent CRD)
  │    │    └─ NO → Check VPC isolation settings
  │    │
  ├─ Check VPC subnet isolation flags
  │    │
  │    ├─ isolated: true but no permit?
  │    │    ├─ YES → Add permit list entry
  │    │    └─ NO → Escalate (unexpected issue)
```

---

**Decision Tree 3: VPCAttachment Shows Success But Doesn't Work**

```
kubectl describe shows no errors, but server has no connectivity
  │
  ├─ Verify VPCAttachment references correct connection
  │    │
  │    ├─ kubectl get vpcattachment <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.connection}'
  │    │
  │    ├─ Connection matches server's actual connection?
  │    │    ├─ NO → Root cause found: Wrong connection reference
  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Verify subnet exists in VPC
  │    │
  │    ├─ kubectl get vpc <vpc> -o yaml | grep <subnet>
  │    │
  │    ├─ Subnet exists?
  │    │    ├─ NO → Root cause found: Subnet doesn't exist
  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check Agent CRD for switch
  │    │
  │    ├─ VLAN configured on interface?
  │    │    ├─ NO → Reconciliation failed (check controller logs)
  │    │    └─ YES → Continue
  │    │
  ├─ Check nativeVLAN setting
  │    │
  │    ├─ VPCAttachment nativeVLAN matches server expectation?
  │    │    ├─ NO → Root cause found: nativeVLAN mismatch
  │    │    └─ YES → Escalate (unexpected issue)
```

### Hands-On Lab (6-7 minutes)

**Lab Title:** Diagnose VPCAttachment Connectivity Failure

**Scenario:**

A developer reports that **server-07** in VPC **customer-app-vpc** cannot reach the gateway or other servers. The VPCAttachment was created this morning and `kubectl describe` shows no error events.

Your task: **Use systematic troubleshooting to identify the root cause.**

**Environment Access:**
- **kubectl:** Already configured
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000
- **Server access:** Available if needed

**Known Information:**
- VPC: `customer-app-vpc`
- Subnet: `frontend` (10.20.10.0/24, gateway 10.20.10.1, VLAN 1025)
- Server: `server-07`
- Connection: `server-07--unbundled--leaf-04` (correct connection name)
- VPCAttachment: `customer-app-vpc-server-07`

---

#### Task 1: Gather Symptoms and Form Hypotheses (2 minutes)

**Objective:** Document symptoms and generate possible causes

**Step 1.1: Document Symptoms**

Write down what you know:
- **Expected behavior:** server-07 should ping gateway 10.20.10.1
- **Actual behavior:** ping fails with "Destination Host Unreachable"
- **Recent change:** VPCAttachment created today
- **kubectl describe:** No error events

**Step 1.2: Form Hypotheses**

Based on symptoms, list possible causes:

1. **Wrong connection name** - VPCAttachment references incorrect switch/connection
2. **Wrong subnet** - VPCAttachment references non-existent subnet
3. **VLAN not configured** - Reconciliation failed, VLAN 1025 not on switch interface
4. **Interface down** - leaf-04/Ethernet interface is down
5. **Server interface misconfigured** - Server enp2s1 not configured correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Symptoms documented
- ✅ At least 3 hypotheses listed

---

#### Task 2: Test Hypotheses with kubectl (3 minutes)

**Objective:** Systematically test each hypothesis using kubectl

**Step 2.1: Check VPCAttachment Configuration**

```bash
# Verify VPCAttachment spec
kubectl get vpcattachment customer-app-vpc-server-07 -o yaml

# Check connection reference
kubectl get vpcattachment customer-app-vpc-server-07 -o jsonpath='{.spec.connection}'

# Expected: server-07--unbundled--leaf-04

# Check subnet reference
kubectl get vpcattachment customer-app-vpc-server-07 -o jsonpath='{.spec.subnet}'

# Expected: customer-app-vpc/frontend
```

**Hypothesis 1 Test:** Does connection match server-07's actual connection?

```bash
# Verify connection exists
kubectl get connection server-07--unbundled--leaf-04 -n fab

# Expected: Connection exists
```

**Result:** Connection reference is correct ✅

---

**Step 2.2: Verify Subnet Exists**

```bash
# Check if frontend subnet exists in customer-app-vpc
kubectl get vpc customer-app-vpc -o yaml | grep -A 5 "frontend:"

# Expected output shows:
#   frontend:
#     subnet: 10.20.10.0/24
#     gateway: 10.20.10.1
#     vlan: 1025
```

**Hypothesis 2 Test:** Does subnet exist in VPC?

**Result:** Subnet exists and VLAN is 1025 ✅

---

**Step 2.3: Check Agent CRD for leaf-04**

```bash
# Get agent status
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab

# Expected: Ready status

# Check which interface server-07 connects to
kubectl get connection server-07--unbundled--leaf-04 -n fab -o yaml | grep "port:"

# Expected output shows: leaf-04/E1/8 (Ethernet8)

# Check interface state in Agent CRD
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces.Ethernet8}' | jq

# Look for:
# - oper: up or down
# - vlans: [list of VLANs]
```

**Hypothesis 3 Test:** Is VLAN 1025 configured on Ethernet8?

**Expected:** VLAN 1025 should be in vlans list

**ACTUAL FINDING:** VLAN **1020** configured, not 1025!

**Root Cause Identified:** VLAN mismatch—VPC expects 1025, but interface has 1020 configured.

---

**Step 2.4: Investigate Why VLAN is Wrong**

```bash
# Check VPC configuration again
kubectl get vpc customer-app-vpc -o yaml | grep -A 10 "frontend:"

# Check all VLANs in use
kubectl get vpc -A -o yaml | grep "vlan:" | sort

# Look for VLAN conflicts
```

**Discovery:** Another VPC is using VLAN 1025. When customer-app-vpc was created, it was allocated VLAN 1020 instead due to conflict!

**Root Cause Confirmed:** VLAN conflict. VPC subnet definition specifies VLAN 1025, but VLANNamespace allocated 1020 due to conflict with existing VPC.

**Solution:** Update customer-app-vpc frontend subnet to use VLAN 1020 (matching actual allocation), or choose a different unused VLAN.

---

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Hypotheses tested systematically
- ✅ Root cause identified (VLAN mismatch)
- ✅ Solution path clear (update VPC VLAN config)

---

#### Task 3: Validate with Grafana (1-2 minutes)

**Objective:** Confirm findings using Grafana dashboards

**Step 3.1: Check Interfaces Dashboard**

1. Open Grafana: http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to "Hedgehog Interfaces" dashboard
3. Filter for `switch="leaf-04"` and `interface="Ethernet8"`
4. Observe:
   - Interface operational state (up/down)
   - VLANs configured on interface
   - Traffic patterns (any traffic?)

**Expected Finding:** Grafana shows VLAN 1020 on Ethernet8 (confirms Agent CRD finding)

---

**Step 3.2: Check Fabric Dashboard**

1. Navigate to "Hedgehog Fabric" dashboard
2. Check BGP sessions for leaf-04
3. Verify all BGP sessions established

**Expected Finding:** BGP sessions healthy (not a BGP issue)

---

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Grafana confirms VLAN 1020 configured (not 1025)
- ✅ Interface is up (not a physical layer issue)
- ✅ BGP healthy (not a routing issue)

---

#### Task 4: Document Root Cause and Solution (1 minute)

**Objective:** Write clear problem statement and solution

**Problem Statement:**

"VPCAttachment customer-app-vpc-server-07 created successfully without errors, but server-07 cannot communicate within VPC. Root cause: VLAN mismatch. VPC subnet specifies VLAN 1025, but switch interface configured with VLAN 1020 due to conflict with existing VPC."

**Solution:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Update VPC subnet VLAN to match allocated VLAN:

```bash
# Edit customer-app-vpc in Gitea
# Change frontend subnet VLAN from 1025 to 1020
# Commit change
# Wait for ArgoCD sync
# Verify with kubectl events
```

**Option 2:** Choose unused VLAN:

```bash
# Check available VLANs
kubectl get vpc -A -o yaml | grep "vlan:" | sort

# Update customer-app-vpc frontend subnet to use unused VLAN (e.g., 1026)
# Commit to Gitea
```

---

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Root cause documented clearly
- ✅ Solution options identified
- ✅ Next steps defined

---

### Wrap-Up & Assessment (2 minutes)

**What You Accomplished:**

You successfully diagnosed a VPCAttachment connectivity failure using **systematic troubleshooting methodology**:
- ✅ Gathered symptoms and formed hypotheses
- ✅ Tested hypotheses systematically using kubectl
- ✅ Identified root cause (VLAN mismatch due to conflict)
- ✅ Validated findings with Grafana
- ✅ Documented solution path

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Systematic approach beats random checking** - Hypothesis-driven investigation saves time
2. **Evidence collection order matters** - Events → Agent CRD → Grafana → Logs
3. **"Success" doesn't mean "working"** - No error events doesn't guarantee correct configuration
4. **Decision trees provide structure** - Follow diagnostic paths for common scenarios
5. **Root cause identification requires testing** - Eliminate possibilities until one remains

**Troubleshooting Mindset:**

- **Stay systematic:** Don't jump to conclusions
- **Test hypotheses:** Verify assumptions with evidence
- **Document findings:** Track what you've checked
- **Think about "why":** Understand the cause, not just the symptom

**Preview of Module 4.2:**

Next, you'll learn **rollback and recovery procedures**—how to safely undo changes when things go wrong, including GitOps rollback, safe deletion order, and handling stuck resources.

### Assessment Questions

#### Question 1: Troubleshooting Methodology

**Scenario:** Server-03 in VPC prod-vpc cannot reach server-04 in the same VPC. You've checked kubectl events (no errors) and verified both VPCAttachments exist.

What is your NEXT diagnostic step using systematic methodology?

- A) Restart the fabric controller
- B) Check Agent CRD to verify VLANs configured on both switch interfaces
- C) Escalate to support immediately
- D) Delete and recreate both VPCAttachments

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) Check Agent CRD to verify VLANs configured on both switch interfaces

**Explanation:**

Following the diagnostic workflow (Layer 1: Events → Layer 2: Agent CRD):

1. **You've completed Layer 1** (kubectl events) - no errors found
2. **Next step is Layer 2** (Agent CRD) - verify switch configuration

**Why B is correct:**
- Agent CRD shows actual switch interface configuration
- Reveals if VLANs are properly configured
- Tests hypothesis: "VLAN configuration issue"

**Why others are wrong:**

**A) Restart controller:**
- No evidence of controller failure
- Premature action without diagnosis
- Could disrupt fabric unnecessarily

**C) Escalate to support:**
- Haven't completed basic troubleshooting
- No evidence collected yet
- Should check Agent CRD first

**D) Delete and recreate VPCAttachments:**
- No diagnosis performed yet
- May not fix underlying issue
- Could make troubleshooting harder (lose state)

**Systematic approach:** Complete evidence collection before taking action.

**Module 4.1 Reference:** Concept 3 - Diagnostic Workflow
</details>

#### Question 2: Common Failure Modes

**Scenario:** You observe these symptoms:
- VPCPeering between vpc-a and vpc-b exists
- kubectl describe shows no errors
- Server in vpc-a can ping its own gateway
- Server in vpc-a CANNOT ping server in vpc-b

Which failure mode is most likely?

- A) BGP peering problem (sessions down)
- B) VPC isolation settings or permit list misconfiguration
- C) Interface errors (physical layer issue)
- D) Configuration drift (GitOps reconciliation failure)

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) VPC isolation settings or permit list misconfiguration

**Explanation:**

**Symptoms indicate:**
- ✅ Intra-VPC connectivity works (can ping gateway)
- ❌ Cross-VPC connectivity fails
- ✅ VPCPeering resource exists
- ✅ No error events

**Why B is correct:**

VPCPeering failure modes include:
1. **Permit list missing subnets** - VPCPeering exists but doesn't include required subnets
2. **VPC isolation=true without permit** - Subnet marked isolated but no permit list entry
3. **Different IPv4Namespaces** - VPCPeering requires same namespace

**Diagnostic steps:**
```bash
# Check permit list
kubectl get vpcpeering vpc-a--vpc-b -o yaml

# Check VPC isolation flags
kubectl get vpc vpc-a -o jsonpath='{.spec.subnets.*.isolated}'
```

**Why others are wrong:**

**A) BGP peering problem:**
- Intra-VPC connectivity works, so BGP likely up
- Would affect more than just cross-VPC traffic
- Check with Grafana Fabric Dashboard first

**C) Interface errors:**
- Would affect intra-VPC connectivity too
- Server can ping gateway (interface working)

**D) Configuration drift:**
- VPCPeering exists (not a sync issue)
- No evidence of ArgoCD OutOfSync

**Module 4.1 Reference:** Concept 2 - Common Failure Modes (Failure Mode 2: BGP Peering Problems)
</details>

---

#### Question 3: Decision Trees

**Scenario:** Using Decision Tree 3 ("VPCAttachment Shows Success But Doesn't Work"), you've verified:
- VPCAttachment references correct connection ✅
- Subnet exists in VPC ✅
- Agent CRD shows VLAN configured on interface ✅

According to the decision tree, what should you check NEXT?

- A) Controller logs for reconciliation errors
- B) Grafana Interface Dashboard for errors
- C) nativeVLAN setting matches server expectation
- D) Escalate immediately (all checks passed)

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** C) nativeVLAN setting matches server expectation

**Explanation:**

**Decision Tree 3 path:**

```
VPCAttachment shows success but doesn't work
  ↓
Verify connection reference ✅ (already checked)
  ↓
Verify subnet exists ✅ (already checked)
  ↓
Check Agent CRD for VLAN ✅ (already checked)
  ↓
→ Check nativeVLAN setting ← YOU ARE HERE
  ↓
Escalate if still unresolved
```

**Why C is correct:**

**nativeVLAN mismatch is a common issue:**
- **VPCAttachment nativeVLAN: false** → Switch sends tagged VLAN traffic
- **Server expects untagged** → Server interface not configured for VLAN tagging
- Result: Traffic mismatch, connectivity fails

**Check:**
```bash
# VPCAttachment nativeVLAN setting
kubectl get vpcattachment <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.nativeVLAN}'

# Server interface configuration (SSH to server)
ip link show enp2s1.1025  # Tagged interface exists?
```

**Why others are wrong:**

**A) Controller logs:**
- Agent CRD shows VLAN configured (reconciliation succeeded)
- Logs won't reveal server-side configuration issue

**B) Grafana Interface Dashboard:**
- Already verified VLAN configured
- Physical layer likely working
- Doesn't check nativeVLAN setting

**D) Escalate immediately:**
- Decision tree not complete yet
- One more hypothesis to test (nativeVLAN)
- Premature escalation

#### Question 4: Diagnostic Workflow

**Scenario:** You're investigating a connectivity issue. You've checked kubectl events (no errors) and Agent CRD (all interfaces up, VLANs configured correctly). Server still cannot communicate.

Why should you check Grafana BEFORE checking controller logs?

- A) Grafana is faster to load than kubectl logs
- B) Grafana provides visual trends and historical context (e.g., intermittent errors over time)
- C) Controller logs are unreliable
- D) Grafana is always the first troubleshooting step

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) Grafana provides visual trends and historical context (e.g., intermittent errors over time)

**Explanation:**

**Diagnostic Workflow Order:**

1. **kubectl events** - Current errors and warnings (fast check)
2. **Agent CRD** - Current switch state (detailed config)
3. **Grafana** - Historical trends and visual patterns ← YOU ARE HERE
4. **Controller logs** - Reconciliation details (specific events)

**Why Grafana before controller logs:**

**Grafana reveals patterns:**
- **Intermittent issues** - Interface errors spiking at certain times
- **Trending issues** - Gradual increase in errors over hours/days
- **Historical context** - When did the issue start? (correlate with changes)

**Example: Interface errors:**
- Agent CRD shows interface currently up, no errors *right now*
- Grafana shows interface had 10,000 input errors 2 hours ago
- Pattern: Intermittent issue, not current state problem

**Controller logs:**
- Show reconciliation events (discrete actions)
- Don't show operational metrics over time
- More useful after Grafana identifies specific resource

**Why others are wrong:**

**A) Grafana is faster:**
- Not the reason for ordering
- kubectl can be just as fast

**C) Controller logs unreliable:**
- False - controller logs are critical for reconciliation debugging
- Just not useful for trending/historical analysis

**D) Grafana always first:**
- False - kubectl events should be first (fastest check for errors)
- Order: Events → Agent CRD → Grafana → Logs

## Technical Requirements

### Diagnostic Commands

**kubectl Event Checking:**
```bash
# Check for Warning events
kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check events for specific resource
kubectl describe vpc <vpc-name>
kubectl describe vpcattachment <attachment-name>

# Check events for resource type
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=VPCAttachment
```

**Agent CRD Inspection:**
```bash
# Check agent readiness
kubectl get agents -n fab

# Get detailed agent status
kubectl get agent <switch-name> -n fab -o yaml

# Check BGP neighbors
kubectl get agent <switch-name> -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.bgpNeighbors}' | jq

# Check interface state
kubectl get agent <switch-name> -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces.<interface>}' | jq

# Example: Check Ethernet8 on leaf-04
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces.Ethernet8}' | jq
```

**VPCAttachment Verification:**
```bash
# Check connection reference
kubectl get vpcattachment <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.connection}'

# Check subnet reference
kubectl get vpcattachment <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.subnet}'

# Verify connection exists
kubectl get connection <connection-name> -n fab
```

**VPC Configuration Checking:**
```bash
# Get VPC subnet configuration
kubectl get vpc <vpc-name> -o yaml | grep -A 10 "<subnet-name>:"

# Check all VLANs in use
kubectl get vpc -A -o yaml | grep "vlan:" | sort

# Check VPC isolation settings
kubectl get vpc <vpc-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.subnets.<subnet>.isolated}'

# Check permit lists
kubectl get vpc <vpc-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.permit}'
```

**Controller Logs:**
```bash
# Check controller logs for resource
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager | grep <resource-name>

# Check for errors
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=200 | grep -i error

# Check reconciliation for VPCAttachment
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager | grep <vpcattachment-name>
```

## Pedagogical Design

### Learning Philosophy Principles Emphasized

#### 1. **Train for Reality, Not Rote** ⭐
- **How:** Realistic troubleshooting scenario (VPCAttachment shows success but doesn't work)
- **Example:** VLAN mismatch due to conflict (common real-world issue)
- **Why:** Prepares students for actual production troubleshooting

#### 2. **Teach the Why Behind the How** ⭐
- **How:** Explains hypothesis-driven investigation methodology
- **Example:** Why check Agent CRD before controller logs (evidence collection order)
- **Why:** Understanding methodology enables adaptation to new scenarios

#### 3. **Focus on What Matters Most** ⭐
- **How:** Covers common failure modes (VPC attachment, BGP, interface errors)
- **Example:** Decision trees for frequent scenarios
- **Why:** High-impact troubleshooting skills for daily operations

#### 4. **Learn by Doing, Not Watching** ⭐
- **How:** Hands-on lab diagnoses real connectivity failure
- **Example:** Students form hypotheses, test with kubectl, identify root cause
- **Why:** Practical troubleshooting builds confidence

#### 5. **Confidence Before Comprehensiveness** ⭐
- **How:** Structured decision trees provide step-by-step guidance
- **Example:** Decision tree for "Server Cannot Communicate in VPC"
- **Why:** Reduces overwhelm, builds systematic approach

#### 6. **Continuous Learning Over Static Mastery**
- **How:** Emphasizes troubleshooting methodology over memorizing solutions
- **Example:** "Apply systematic approach to new issues you've never seen"
- **Why:** Methodology transfers to future problems

---

### Target Audience Considerations

#### For Cloud-Native Learners

**What They Bring:**
- Kubernetes troubleshooting experience (kubectl describe, logs)
- Familiarity with declarative configuration
- Experience with Grafana/Prometheus observability

**What's New:**
- Network-specific failure modes (VLAN mismatch, BGP issues)
- Agent CRD as source of truth for switch state
- Physical layer diagnostics (interface errors, cables)

**Bridge Strategy:**
- Relate decision trees to runbooks (familiar concept)
- Use kubectl-first troubleshooting (comfort zone)
- Frame BGP issues as "service discovery problems"

---

#### For Networking Professionals

**What They Bring:**
- Deep troubleshooting experience (physical layer, routing, switching)
- Understanding of VLAN conflicts, BGP states, interface errors
- Systematic diagnostic methodology

**What's New:**
- Kubernetes-native troubleshooting (kubectl events, CRDs)
- Declarative configuration troubleshooting (GitOps drift)
- Agent CRD vs. switch CLI for state inspection

**Bridge Strategy:**
- Emphasize Agent CRD as "switch state API" (familiar concept)
- Map decision trees to traditional troubleshooting flowcharts
- Relate GitOps drift to configuration management issues

---

### Common Challenges and Mitigation

#### Challenge 1: Jumping to Conclusions

**Stumbling Block:** Students skip hypothesis testing and assume cause

**Symptoms:**
- "It's probably a BGP issue" (without checking)
- Taking action before diagnosis (restarting controller)

**Mitigation:**
- Explicit methodology teaching (Step 1: Form hypothesis, Step 2: Test)
- Lab enforces systematic approach (Task 1: hypotheses, Task 2: test)
- Assessment tests methodology (Question 1)

---

#### Challenge 2: Over-Reliance on One Tool

**Stumbling Block:** Students only use kubectl or only use Grafana

**Symptoms:**
- Missing VLAN mismatch (not checking Agent CRD)
- Missing intermittent issues (not checking Grafana trends)

**Mitigation:**
- Diagnostic workflow teaches layered approach
- Lab requires using multiple tools (kubectl + Grafana)
- Assessment emphasizes tool ordering (Question 4)

---

#### Challenge 3: "Success" Means "Working" Assumption

**Stumbling Block:** Students trust kubectl describe "no errors" too much

**Symptoms:**
- Don't investigate further when events show success
- Miss configuration mismatches (wrong VLAN allocated)

**Mitigation:**
- Lab scenario specifically uses "no error events but doesn't work"
- Teaches: Verify configuration matches expectation, not just absence of errors
- Assessment Question 3 tests this concept

---

#### Challenge 4: Random Checking vs. Systematic Approach

**Stumbling Block:** Students check things randomly hoping to find issue

**Symptoms:**
- Checking unrelated components
- Wasting time on unlikely causes
- Missing obvious issues

**Mitigation:**
- Concept 1 explicitly contrasts random vs systematic
- Decision trees provide structure (follow paths)
- Lab requires documenting hypotheses before testing

---

### Confidence-Building Opportunities

**Win 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- **Moment:** Task 1 - Successfully listing possible causes
- **Feeling:** "I can think like a troubleshooter"
- **Teaching Point:** "You generated multiple hypotheses—that's expert behavior"

**Win 2: Root Cause Identification**
- **Moment:** Task 2 - Finding VLAN mismatch in Agent CRD
- **Feeling:** "I found the issue using systematic approach"
- **Teaching Point:** "You didn't guess—you tested hypotheses until you found proof"

**Win 3: Multi-Tool Validation**
- **Moment:** Task 3 - Confirming findings in Grafana
- **Feeling:** "I can use multiple tools together"
- **Teaching Point:** "You validated findings with different data sources—that's thorough troubleshooting"

**Win 4: Assessment Success**
- **Moment:** Correctly answering methodology questions
- **Feeling:** "I understand troubleshooting principles, not just commands"
- **Teaching Point:** "You can now apply this methodology to issues you've never seen before"
