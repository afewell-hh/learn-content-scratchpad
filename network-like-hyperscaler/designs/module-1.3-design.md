## The Three Interfaces Framework

### Interface Roles

| Interface | Role | Primary Use Cases | Information Type |
|-----------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **kubectl** | **Read/Inspect** | Current state, status checks, troubleshooting | Real-time cluster state |
| **Gitea** | **Write/Configure** | Create configs, edit VPCs, audit changes | Declarative desired state |
| **Grafana** | **Observe/Monitor** | Health trends, metrics, alerting | Time-series operational data |

### Decision Matrix for Students

**Use kubectl when you need to:**
- ‚úÖ Check current state of VPCs, switches, connections
- ‚úÖ View events and reconciliation status (errors, warnings)
- ‚úÖ List all resources of a type
- ‚úÖ Troubleshoot why something isn't working
- ‚úÖ Get detailed YAML output for a resource

**Use Gitea when you need to:**
- ‚úÖ Create or modify VPC configurations
- ‚úÖ Review configuration history (who changed what, when)
- ‚úÖ Compare configurations across time (diffs)
- ‚úÖ Understand current desired state
- ‚úÖ Audit configuration changes for compliance

**Use Grafana when you need to:**
- ‚úÖ Monitor fabric health over time
- ‚úÖ View switch metrics (CPU, memory, interfaces)
- ‚úÖ Identify trends (traffic patterns, resource usage)
- ‚úÖ Check if switches are healthy
- ‚úÖ Aggregate logs from multiple switches

## Lab Structure

### Lab Overview
**Total Duration**: 12-15 minutes
**Structure**: 3 parts (one per interface) + integrated troubleshooting scenario
**Environment**: Uses `myfirst-vpc` VPC created in Module 1.2

**Part 1**: The Read Interface - kubectl (4-5 min)
**Part 2**: The Write Interface - Gitea (3-4 min)
**Part 3**: The Observe Interface - Grafana (5-6 min)
**Synthesis**: Using All Three Together (2 min - embedded in assessment)

---

## Part 1: The Read Interface - kubectl (4-5 minutes)

### Learning Objective
Use kubectl to inspect current cluster state, understand CRD status fields, and troubleshoot resource issues.

### Task 1.1: Inspect Your VPC (2 minutes)

**Objective**: View the VPC created in Module 1.2 and verify its reconciliation

**Commands**:
```bash
# List all VPCs in the cluster
kubectl get vpcs

# Get detailed information about myfirst-vpc
kubectl get vpc myfirst-vpc -o yaml

# Check reconciliation status via events
kubectl describe vpc myfirst-vpc
```

**Expected Output** (kubectl describe excerpt):
```
Name:         myfirst-vpc
Namespace:    default
Labels:       fabric.githedgehog.com/ipv4ns=default
              fabric.githedgehog.com/vlanns=default
...
Spec:
  Ipv4Namespace:  default
  Subnets:
    Default:
      Dhcp:
        Enable:  true
        Range:
          End:    10.0.10.250
          Start:  10.0.10.10
      Gateway:  10.0.10.1
      Subnet:   10.0.10.0/24
      Vlan:     1010
  Vlan Namespace:  default
Events:            <none>
```

**Key Observations for Students**:
- üìä **Events: \<none>** - VPC reconciled successfully (no errors)
- üìä **Spec fields present** - Configuration is stored in cluster
- üìä **Gateway auto-assigned** - Hedgehog computed gateway IP (10.0.10.1)

> üí° **Hedgehog's Event-Based Reconciliation**
> VPCs use event-based reconciliation - if `kubectl describe` shows no error events, the VPC is working. VNI and VLAN assignments happen transparently in the switches. This "no news is good news" model simplifies Day 2 operations.

**Student Exercise**:
> **Question**: How can you verify that `myfirst-vpc` was successfully reconciled?
> **How to find it**: Run `kubectl describe vpc myfirst-vpc` and check the Events section
> **Expected Answer**: No error/warning events = successful reconciliation

---

### Task 1.2: Explore Fabric Resources (2 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover what other Hedgehog CRDs exist and their relationships

**Commands**:
```bash
# List all switches (agents)
kubectl get agents -A

# List all connections between switches and servers
kubectl get connections -A

# List all VPC attachments (servers connected to VPCs)
kubectl get vpcattachments -A
```

**Expected Output - Switches**:
```
NAMESPACE   NAME       ROLE          DESCR           APPLIED   VERSION
default     leaf-01    server-leaf   VS-01 MCLAG 1   2m        v0.87.4

default     spine-01   spine         VS-06           4m        v0.87.4
default     spine-02   spine         VS-07           3m        v0.87.4
```

**Key Observations**:
- üîç 7 switches total (2 spines, 5 leaves)
- üîç Role field indicates spine vs leaf
- üîç APPLIED column shows last successful config push
- üîç VERSION shows Hedgehog agent version

NAME                                 TYPE           AGE
leaf-01--mclag-domain--leaf-02       mclag-domain   2h
server-01--mclag--leaf-01--leaf-02   mclag          2h
server-02--mclag--leaf-01--leaf-02   mclag          2h
server-03--unbundled--leaf-01        unbundled      2h
...
```

**Key Observations**:
- üîç Connection names describe topology: `server--type--switches`
- üîç Types: mclag (dual-homed), unbundled (single), eslag, bundled
- üîç Connections are pre-configured (Day 1, not Day 2 operations)

**Student Exercise**:
> **Question**: How many spine switches are in the fabric?
> **How to find it**: `kubectl get agents -A | grep spine | wc -l`
> **Expected Answer**: 2

### Part 1 Summary

**What Students Learned**:
- ‚úÖ How to inspect VPC state with kubectl
- ‚úÖ Understanding event-based reconciliation (no errors = success)
- ‚úÖ Listing fabric resources (agents, connections)
- ‚úÖ Difference between `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe`

**kubectl Quick Reference**:
```bash
kubectl get vpcs                  # List all VPCs
kubectl get vpc <name> -o yaml    # Detailed VPC info
kubectl describe vpc <name>       # Check events for reconciliation status
kubectl get agents -A             # List switches
kubectl get connections -A        # List connections
```

### Understanding Hedgehog's Reconciliation Model

**Why VPCs Have Minimal Status**:

Hedgehog uses different reconciliation patterns for different resource types:

| CRD Type | Status Approach | How to Check | Example |
|----------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **Agent** (switches) | Rich status fields | `kubectl get agent <name> -o yaml` | `status.conditions`, `status.state.bgpNeighbors` |
| **VPC** (network config) | Event-based | `kubectl describe vpc <name>` | Events section shows errors |

**Why the difference?**
- **Agents** represent physical infrastructure (switches) with complex state to monitor
- **VPCs** represent desired configuration - reconciliation is binary (works or errors)

**For Day 2 Operations**:
- **Agents**: Use `kubectl get agent -o yaml` to see detailed switch status
- **VPCs**: Use `kubectl describe vpc` and check for error events
- **Rule of thumb**: No error events = VPC is operational

**Teaching Moment**:
> üí° This event-based model is actually *simpler* for troubleshooting:
> - No complex status fields to parse
> - Errors appear immediately as events
> - "No news is good news" - if no errors, it's working
> - VNI/VLAN assignments happen transparently (visible on switches via Agent status)

## Integrated Troubleshooting Scenario

### Scenario: "My VPC Isn't Working"

**Presented to Students**:
> A colleague tells you: "I created a VPC called `broken-vpc` but servers can't get DHCP addresses. Can you help troubleshoot?"

**Troubleshooting Methodology - Using All Three Interfaces**:

#### Step 1: Check Configuration (Gitea)
**Question**: Is the VPC configured correctly in Git?

**Actions**:
1. Open Gitea ‚Üí navigate to `vpcs/` directory
2. Look for `broken-vpc.yaml` file
3. Review DHCP configuration in the file

**What to look for**:
```yaml
spec:
  subnets:
    default:
      dhcp:
        enable: true        # ‚úÖ Should be true
        range:
          start: 10.x.x.10  # ‚úÖ Should be valid IP
          end: 10.x.x.250   # ‚úÖ Should be > start
```

**Teaching Point**: If config is wrong in Git, fix it there (source of truth)

#### Step 2: Check Deployment Status (kubectl)
**Question**: Did the VPC actually get created in the cluster?

**Actions**:
```bash
# Check if VPC exists
kubectl get vpc broken-vpc

# Check reconciliation via events
kubectl describe vpc broken-vpc

# Look specifically for error events
kubectl describe vpc broken-vpc | tail -20
```

**What to look for**:
- **VPC exists** in `kubectl get` output
- **Events section** shows no errors (healthy) or specific error messages
- **Recent events** at bottom of describe output show reconciliation activity

**Common Error Events**:
- "Subnet overlaps with existing VPC" = configuration conflict
- "Invalid VLAN in namespace" = VLAN allocation problem
- "DHCP range invalid" = IP range configuration error

> üí° **Event-Based Troubleshooting**
> No error events = VPC reconciled successfully. If you see Warning or Error events, the message tells you exactly what's wrong. This is simpler than parsing status fields!

**Teaching Point**: kubectl events show reconciliation result (errors if any)

---

#### Step 3: Check Fabric Health (Grafana)
**Question**: Are the switches healthy and able to serve DHCP?

**Actions**:
1. Open Grafana Fabric Dashboard
2. Check switch status (all green?)
3. Open Platform Dashboard
4. Check Fabricator errors (should be 0)
5. Open Logs Dashboard
6. Search for "broken-vpc" or "DHCP" errors

**What to look for**:
- Red switches = hardware/connectivity issue
- Fabricator errors = reconciliation loop failing
- DHCP relay logs = switches trying to forward requests
- Error logs = specific failure messages

**Teaching Point**: Grafana shows operational health separate from configuration

---

### Troubleshooting Decision Tree

```
My VPC Isn't Working
    ‚Üì
Is the config in Gitea correct?
    ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Fix config in Gitea, commit, wait for sync
    ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí ‚Üì
              Does kubectl show the VPC exists?
                  ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Check ArgoCD sync status
                  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí ‚Üì
                            Are there error events in kubectl describe?
                                ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Fix configuration issue (event message explains what)
                                ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí ‚Üì
                                          Are switches healthy in Grafana?
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Check Fabric/Platform dashboards
                                              ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Check Logs dashboard for DHCP errors
```

**Student Exercise**:
> **Question**: What's the first interface you should check when troubleshooting "VPC not working"?
> **Expected Answer**: Gitea (verify configuration is correct at source)

## Assessment Questions

### Question 1: Interface Selection (Multiple Choice)
**Stem**: You need to view historical CPU usage trends for spine-01 over the last 24 hours. Which interface should you use?

A) kubectl
B) Gitea
C) Grafana ‚úì
D) ArgoCD

**Explanation**: Grafana stores time-series metrics and can display trends. kubectl shows current state only (snapshot). Gitea is for configuration, not metrics.

**Learning Objective**: LO #1 - Select the appropriate interface

---

### Question 2: kubectl Event Interpretation (Multiple Choice)
**Stem**: You run `kubectl describe vpc test-vpc` and see this event:
```
Warning  ReconcileFailed  2m  fabricator  Subnet 10.10.10.0/24 overlaps with existing VPC 'prod-vpc'
```
What does this mean?

A) The VPC is being deployed (this is normal)
B) The VPC configuration has an error that must be fixed ‚úì
C) The VPC is waiting for switches to become available
D) The Fabricator controller needs to be restarted

**Explanation**: Warning/Error events indicate configuration problems that prevent reconciliation. This specific event shows a subnet conflict - the VPC cannot be created until the configuration is fixed (choose non-overlapping subnet). No error events = successful reconciliation.

**Learning Objective**: LO #2 - Interpret kubectl CRD output

---

### Question 3: Gitea Audit Trail (Multiple Choice)
**Stem**: Your manager asks "When was the production-vpc modified and by whom?" Which Gitea feature should you use?

A) File browser
B) Commit history ‚úì
C) Branch manager
D) Pull requests

**Explanation**: Commit history shows all changes with timestamps and authors. Each commit records who made the change and when.

**Learning Objective**: LO #3 - Navigate Gitea for configuration audit

---

### Question 4: Grafana Dashboard Selection (Multiple Choice)
**Stem**: You suspect a switch is dropping packets due to a bad cable. Which Grafana dashboard is MOST useful?

A) Fabric Dashboard
B) Platform Dashboard
C) Interfaces Dashboard ‚úì
D) Node Exporter Dashboard

**Explanation**: Interfaces Dashboard shows error counters (CRC errors, drops, discards) which indicate physical layer issues. Fabric Dashboard shows health but not detailed errors.

**Learning Objective**: LO #4 - Read Grafana dashboards

---

### Question 5: Troubleshooting Methodology (Multiple Choice)
**Stem**: A VPC appears to be configured correctly in Gitea but isn't working. What should you check NEXT?

A) Recreate the VPC in Gitea
B) Use kubectl to verify the VPC was deployed ‚úì
C) Check Grafana for switch health
D) Contact support immediately

**Explanation**: Follow the troubleshooting flow: Config (Gitea) ‚Üí Deployment (kubectl) ‚Üí Health (Grafana). If Gitea config is correct, verify deployment actually happened using kubectl.

**Learning Objective**: LO #5 - Correlate information across interfaces

---

### Question 6: Interface Correlation (Scenario-Based)
**Stem**: You see in Grafana that spine-01 is showing "Down" status. What should you do FIRST?

A) Reboot spine-01
B) Check kubectl for spine-01 agent status ‚úì
C) Edit spine-01 config in Gitea
D) Check Platform Dashboard

**Explanation**: Grafana shows symptoms (switch down). kubectl can tell you more detail about WHY (agent not reporting, config errors, etc.). Always gather more information before taking action.

**Learning Objective**: LO #6 - Apply troubleshooting methodology

---

## Instructor Notes

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Why use three different tools? Isn't that complicated?"**
A: Each tool has a specific purpose. kubectl for current state (what's happening now), Gitea for configuration (what should happen), Grafana for trends (what's been happening over time). Using the right tool for the job is more efficient than trying to make one tool do everything.

**Q: "Can I use kubectl to change VPC configuration?"**
A: Technically yes (`kubectl edit` or `kubectl apply`), but don't. Always change configuration through Gitea (Git) to maintain audit trail and GitOps workflow. Direct kubectl edits bypass Git history and will be overwritten by ArgoCD.

**Q: "Which Grafana dashboard should I check first?"**
A: Start with Fabric Dashboard (overall health), then drill down to specific dashboards based on symptoms. For link issues ‚Üí Interfaces. For control plane issues ‚Üí Platform. For capacity ‚Üí CRM.

**Q: "What if kubectl and Grafana show different information?"**
A: kubectl shows real-time cluster state (authoritative). Grafana shows metrics with slight delay (30-60 seconds). If they differ, kubectl is more current. Grafana is better for trends, kubectl for current state.

### Teaching Tips

1. **Demonstrate Correlation**: Show the same VPC in all three interfaces simultaneously (three browser tabs). Point out how information in one interface complements another.

2. **Use Real Examples**: Reference the `myfirst-vpc` from Module 1.2 throughout. Students already know this VPC, so focus is on tool usage, not VPC concepts.

3. **Emphasize Decision-Making**: Constantly ask "which tool would you use for X?" to build decision-making muscle memory.

4. **Dashboard Tour Pacing**: Don't get bogged down in every Grafana panel. Goal is familiarity, not mastery. Students will see dashboards again in Module 3.

5. **Troubleshooting Practice**: Walk through the troubleshooting scenario slowly, explicitly calling out "Now we use Gitea because..." "Next we use kubectl because..."

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Students overwhelmed by 6 Grafana dashboards
**Solution**: Focus on Fabric & Platform (most important), skim the rest. Provide cheat sheet of "which dashboard for which problem"

**Issue**: kubectl output verbose and intimidating
**Solution**: Use `grep` to focus on relevant fields. Teach `kubectl get vpc <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.state}'` for specific fields.

**Issue**: Gitea UI slightly different from GitHub
**Solution**: Point out similarities (commits, diffs, files), acknowledge differences. Most Git concepts transfer.

### Validation Checklist (For Testing)

Before module release, validate:
- [ ] All kubectl commands execute successfully
- [ ] `myfirst-vpc` exists and shows correct status
- [ ] Gitea commit history has at least 3 commits
- [ ] All 6 Grafana dashboards accessible
- [ ] Grafana shows metrics from all 7 switches
- [ ] Timing: Lab completes in 12-15 minutes
- [ ] Assessment questions render correctly
- [ ] All URLs in lab instructions work
- [ ] Screenshots/diagrams present (if added during content development)
