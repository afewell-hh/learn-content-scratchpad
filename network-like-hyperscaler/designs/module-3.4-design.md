## Content Outline

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Hook: When to Ask for Help**

> You've completed Modules 3.1-3.3, learning to:
> - Query Prometheus metrics
> - Interpret Grafana dashboards
> - Check kubectl events and Agent CRD status
>
> These skills enable you to self-resolve **many** common issues (VLAN conflicts, connection misconfigurations, etc.).
>
> But sometimes, despite your troubleshooting, you'll encounter issues that require **support escalation**:
> - Agent disconnects repeatedly
> - Controller crashes
> - Switch hardware failures
> - Unexpected fabric behavior
> - Performance degradation with unknown cause

**The Critical Question:**

**When do I escalate vs keep troubleshooting?**

**And when I escalate, what information does support need?**

**What You'll Learn:**

- Pre-escalation diagnostic checklist (systematic health check)
- Evidence collection (kubectl, logs, events, Agent status, Grafana screenshots)
- Escalation triggers (when to escalate)
- Support ticket best practices (clear problem statement + diagnostics)
- Diagnostic package creation (bundle for support)
- Support boundaries (configuration issues vs bugs)

**The Support Philosophy:**

> **"Support is not a last resort—it's a strategic resource."**
>
> Escalating early with good diagnostics is **better** than spending hours on an unsolvable problem.
>
> This module teaches you to:
> 1. **Try first** (self-resolve configuration issues)
> 2. **Collect diagnostics** (systematic evidence gathering)
> 3. **Escalate confidently** (with comprehensive data)

### Core Concepts (5-6 minutes)

#### Concept 1: Pre-Escalation Diagnostic Checklist

**Before Escalating, Complete This Checklist:**

This systematic health check ensures you've tried basic troubleshooting and collected necessary diagnostics.

**Step 1: Kubernetes Resource Health**

```bash
# Check all fabric CRDs
kubectl get vpc,vpcattachment,vpcpeering -A
kubectl get switches,servers,connections,agents -n fab

# Check controller pods
kubectl get pods -n fab

# Expected: All pods Running
# If CrashLoopBackOff or Error → escalation trigger
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Are all expected resources present?
- Are controller pods running?
- Are there any pods in error state?

---

**Step 2: Kubernetes Events (Last 1 Hour)**

```bash
# Check for warning events
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --field-selector type=Warning --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check for VPC/VPCAttachment errors
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=VPC
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=VPCAttachment
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Are there any Warning events?
- Do error messages indicate configuration issue (fixable) or bug (escalate)?
- Are events related to the reported issue?

---

**Step 3: Switch Agent Status**

```bash
# List all agents
kubectl get agents -n fab

# Check for agents not Ready
kubectl get agents -n fab -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}{"\n"}{end}'

# Expected: All agents show "True"
# If "False" or empty → investigate agent
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Are all switches showing agents?
- Are all agents Ready?
- When was last heartbeat? (recently = healthy)

---

**Step 4: BGP Health (from Agent CRD or Prometheus)**

**Option A: kubectl (per switch)**

```bash
# Check BGP neighbors for leaf-01
kubectl get agent leaf-01 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.bgpNeighbors}' | jq
```

**Option B: Prometheus (all neighbors)**

```promql
# Query all BGP neighbors not in "established" state
bgp_neighbor_state{state!="established"}
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Are all BGP sessions established?
- If sessions down, which switches and neighbors affected?

---

**Step 5: Grafana Dashboard Review**

**Fabric Dashboard:**
- BGP sessions all up?
- VPC count as expected?

**Interfaces Dashboard:**
- High error rates on any interface?
- Unexpected down interfaces?

**Platform Dashboard:**
- High CPU/memory on any switch?
- Temperature warnings?
- Failed PSUs or fans?

**Logs Dashboard:**
- Recent ERROR logs?
- What do error messages say?

**Critical Resources Dashboard:**
- Any ASIC resource > 90%?

---

**Step 6: Controller and Agent Logs**

```bash
# Fabric controller logs (last 200 lines)
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=200

# Agent logs (if needed - per switch)
# Agents run on switches, check via switch console or SONiC CLI
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Are there ERROR or PANIC messages in controller logs?
- Do logs explain the issue?
- Are there reconciliation loops?

---

**Checklist Outcomes:**

After completing checklist, you'll have:

**A) Self-Resolvable Issue**
- Configuration error (VLAN conflict, wrong connection name, subnet overlap)
- → Fix in Gitea, commit, verify

**B) Escalation-Worthy Issue**
- Controller crashing
- Agent repeatedly disconnecting
- Hardware failure
- Unexpected behavior not explained by configuration
- → Collect full diagnostics, create support ticket

---

#### Concept 2: Evidence Collection (What to Gather)

**Complete Diagnostic Package Includes:**

**1. Problem Statement**
- What is not working?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior

**2. Kubernetes CRD State**

```bash
# VPC resources
kubectl get vpc,vpcattachment,vpcpeering -A -o yaml > crds-vpc.yaml

# Wiring resources
kubectl get switches,servers,connections -n fab -o yaml > crds-wiring.yaml

# Agents
kubectl get agents -n fab -o yaml > crds-agents.yaml

# Namespaces
kubectl get ipv4namespace,vlannamespace -A -o yaml > crds-namespaces.yaml
```

**3. Kubernetes Events**

```bash
# All events, last hour
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' > events.log

# Warning events only
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --field-selector type=Warning > events-warnings.log
```

**4. Controller Logs**

```bash
# Fabric controller
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=2000 > controller.log

# If controller crashed, get previous logs
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --previous > controller-previous.log
```

**5. Agent Status (per affected switch)**

```bash
# Full agent YAML
kubectl get agent leaf-01 -n fab -o yaml > agent-leaf-01.yaml

# BGP neighbors
kubectl get agent leaf-01 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.bgpNeighbors}' | jq > agent-leaf-01-bgp.json

# Interfaces
kubectl get agent leaf-01 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces}' | jq > agent-leaf-01-interfaces.json

# Platform health
kubectl get agent leaf-01 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.platform}' | jq > agent-leaf-01-platform.json
```

**6. Prometheus Queries (if relevant)**

```bash
# Example: BGP sessions down
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=bgp_neighbor_state{state!="established"}' > bgp-down.json

# Example: Interface error rates
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(interface_errors_in[5m])' > interface-errors.json
```

**7. Grafana Dashboard Screenshots**

- Screenshot of Fabric Dashboard showing issue
- Screenshot of Interfaces Dashboard (if relevant)
- Screenshot of Logs Dashboard showing errors
- Screenshot of Critical Resources Dashboard (if capacity issue)

**8. Version Information**

```bash
# Kubernetes version
kubectl version > kubectl-version.txt

# Fabric controller version (from pod image)
kubectl get deployment -n fab fabric-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' > controller-version.txt

# Agent versions
kubectl get agents -n fab -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.version}{"\n"}{end}' > agent-versions.txt
```

**9. Topology Information**

```bash
# List all switches
kubectl get switches -n fab > switches.txt

# List all connections
kubectl get connections -n fab > connections.txt

# List all servers
kubectl get servers -n fab > servers.txt
```

**10. Timestamp Marker**

```bash
# Mark when diagnostics collected
date > diagnostic-timestamp.txt
echo "Issue: [your problem description]" >> diagnostic-timestamp.txt
```

---

#### Concept 3: Escalation Triggers (When to Escalate)

**ESCALATE when:**

**1. Controller Issues**
- Controller pod CrashLoopBackOff
- Controller logs show PANIC or fatal errors
- Controller repeatedly restarting
- Reconciliation loops (same resource reconciling repeatedly without success)

**2. Agent Connectivity Issues**
- Agent disconnects repeatedly (not due to switch reboot)
- Agent cannot connect to switch (switch reachable, credentials correct)
- Agent status shows unexpected errors

**3. Hardware Failures**
- Switch not booting
- Switch kernel panics
- Hardware sensor errors (beyond PSU/fan replacement)

**4. Unexpected Behavior**
- VPC/VPCAttachment appears successful but doesn't work
- Configuration applied but not taking effect
- Metrics show impossible values
- BGP sessions flapping without network issues

**5. Performance Issues**
- Severe performance degradation (not explained by capacity)
- Controller taking very long to reconcile
- API server slow or unresponsive

**6. Data Plane Issues**
- Traffic forwarding failures (config looks correct)
- Packet loss not explained by congestion
- VNI conflicts or VXLAN issues

---

**DO NOT ESCALATE (Self-Resolve) when:**

**1. Configuration Errors**
- VLAN conflicts (choose different VLAN)
- Subnet overlaps (choose non-overlapping subnet)
- Invalid CIDR notation (fix CIDR)
- Connection not found (fix connection name)
- Missing VPC reference (create VPC first)

**2. Expected Warnings**
- Unused interfaces down (no servers attached)
- VPC deletion blocked by active attachments (delete attachments first)
- Validation errors on initial VPC creation (fix YAML syntax)

**3. Operational Questions**
- How to configure X? (check documentation)
- Best practices for VPC design? (consult design guides)
- How many VPCs can I create? (capacity planning - check ASIC resources)

---

**Gray Area (Try First, Then Escalate):**

- Intermittent issues (collect diagnostics during occurrence)
- Slow reconciliation (check controller CPU/memory first)
- Logs show warnings but no errors (investigate warnings first)

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If events/logs clearly explain issue (config error) → Self-resolve
- If events/logs show unexpected errors or no explanation → Escalate

---

#### Concept 4: Support Ticket Best Practices

**Effective Support Ticket Template:**

```markdown
# Issue Summary

**Problem:** [One-sentence description]
Example: "VPC vpc-prod reconciles successfully but server cannot get DHCP"

**Severity:** [P1=Critical/Down, P2=Major/Degraded, P3=Minor/Workaround, P4=Question]

**Impacted Resources:**
- VPCs: vpc-prod
- Servers: server-05, server-06
- Switches: leaf-03

**Started:** [Date/time when issue began]
Example: 2025-10-16 10:30 UTC

**Recent Changes:** [Any configuration changes in last 24 hours?]
Example: "Created new VPCAttachment for server-06 to vpc-prod/frontend subnet"

---

# Environment

**Hedgehog Version:**
- Controller: [from kubectl get deployment -n fab fabric-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}']
- Agents: [from kubectl get agents -n fab -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.version}']

**Fabric Topology:**
- Spines: 2 (spine-01, spine-02)
- Leaves: 5 (leaf-01 through leaf-05)
- Servers: 10

**Kubernetes Version:** [from kubectl version --short]

---

# Symptoms

**Observable Symptoms:**
1. [What you see in Grafana/kubectl/logs]
2. [Specific error messages]
3. [Metrics showing issue]

Example:
1. Grafana Interfaces Dashboard: leaf-03/Ethernet10 shows up, but 0 traffic
2. kubectl events: VPCAttachment shows "Ready" with no errors
3. Server reports DHCP timeout

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should be happening?]
Example: "Server should receive DHCP lease from 10.10.1.10-10.10.1.99 range"

**Actual Behavior:**
[What is actually happening?]
Example: "Server DHCP request times out, no lease received"

---

# Diagnostics Completed

**Checklist:**
- [x] kubectl events checked (attached: events.log)
- [x] Agent status reviewed (attached: agent-leaf-03.yaml)
- [x] BGP health verified (all sessions established)
- [x] Grafana dashboards checked (screenshots attached)
- [x] Controller logs collected (attached: controller.log)
- [x] VPC/VPCAttachment CRDs collected (attached: crds-vpc.yaml)

**Troubleshooting Attempted:**
1. [What did you try?]
2. [What were the results?]

Example:
1. Checked kubectl events for vpc-prod and VPCAttachment - no errors
2. Verified VLAN 1015 configured on leaf-03/Ethernet10 in Agent CRD
3. Confirmed DHCPSubnet resource created (vpc-prod--frontend)
4. Checked DHCP server logs - no requests received from server-05 MAC
5. Verified server network interface up and requesting DHCP

**Findings:**
[What did you discover during troubleshooting?]

Example:
"All configuration appears correct, but DHCP requests from server-05 not reaching DHCP server. Switch shows interface up and VLAN configured. No errors in any logs."

**Business Impact:** Development environment, non-critical
**Workaround:** None identified

---

# Additional Context

[Any other relevant information]

Example:
"This VPCAttachment configuration worked successfully for server-01 through server-04 on same VPC. Server-05 and server-06 use identical configuration pattern, only difference is server name and connection reference."
```

---

1. **Be Concise:** One-sentence summary at top
2. **Be Specific:** Exact resource names, timestamps, error messages
3. **Show Your Work:** List troubleshooting attempts
4. **Attach Diagnostics:** Complete diagnostic bundle
5. **Describe Impact:** Severity, affected users
6. **Avoid Assumptions:** Report observations, not conclusions (unless clear)
7. **Include Screenshots:** Visual evidence from Grafana

---

#### Concept 5: Diagnostic Collection Automation

**Scripted Diagnostic Collection**

Manually collecting diagnostics is time-consuming. Create a script to automate.

**diagnostic-collect.sh:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Hedgehog Fabric Diagnostic Collection Script

### Hands-On Lab (6-7 minutes)

**Lab Title:** Complete Pre-Escalation Diagnostic Collection

**Scenario:**

A user reports that their newly created VPC `customer-app-vpc` with VPCAttachment for `server-07` isn't working. Server-07 cannot reach other servers in the VPC. You'll execute the full diagnostic checklist, collect evidence, and determine if this requires escalation or self-resolution.

**Environment Access:**
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000
- **Prometheus:** http://localhost:9090
- **kubectl:** Already configured

---

#### Task 1: Execute Pre-Escalation Checklist (3 minutes)

**Objective:** Systematically check fabric health

**Step 1.1: Kubernetes Resource Health**

```bash
# Check if VPC exists
kubectl get vpc customer-app-vpc

# Check if VPCAttachment exists
kubectl get vpcattachment -A | grep server-07

# Check controller pods
kubectl get pods -n fab
```

**Expected:** All resources exist, controller pods Running

---

**Step 1.2: Check Events**

```bash
# VPC events
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=customer-app-vpc

# VPCAttachment events
kubectl describe vpcattachment <attachment-name-for-server-07>

# Warning events (all)
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --field-selector type=Warning --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**Look for:**
- Any Warning events?
- Configuration errors (VLAN conflict, connection not found)?
- Reconciliation failures?

---

**Step 1.3: Agent Status**

```bash
# Which switch connects to server-07?
kubectl get connections -n fab | grep server-07

# Example output: server-07--unbundled--leaf-04

# Check leaf-04 agent
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab

# Check interface state
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.interfaces.Ethernet8}' | jq
```

**Look for:**
- Agent Ready?
- Interface oper = up?
- VLAN configured?

---

**Step 1.4: BGP Health**

```bash
# Check BGP for leaf-04
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o jsonpath='{.status.state.bgpNeighbors}' | jq

# OR use Prometheus
curl -s 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=bgp_neighbor_state{switch="leaf-04",state!="established"}'
```

**Expected:** All BGP sessions established

---

**Step 1.5: Grafana Review**

1. **Open Fabric Dashboard:**
   - All BGP sessions up?

2. **Open Interfaces Dashboard:**
   - Find leaf-04/Ethernet8 (server-07 interface)
   - Is interface up?
   - Is there traffic?
   - Any errors?

3. **Open Logs Dashboard:**
   - Any recent errors?
   - Filter for `leaf-04` logs
   - Any DHCP errors?

---

**Step 1.6: Controller Logs**

```bash
# Check for errors in controller
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=100 | grep -i error

# Check for VPC reconciliation logs
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=200 | grep customer-app-vpc
```

---

**Checklist Completion:**

After Step 1, you should have determined:

**A) Self-Resolvable Configuration Issue**
- Example: VLAN conflict event found
- → Proceed to fix in Gitea

**B) Escalation-Worthy Issue**
- Example: No events, but server still can't communicate
- → Proceed to Task 2 (collect full diagnostics)

---

#### Task 2: Collect Diagnostic Evidence (2-3 minutes)

**Objective:** Gather complete diagnostic bundle

**Option A: Manual Collection**

```bash
# Create diagnostics directory
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
OUTDIR="hedgehog-diagnostics-${TIMESTAMP}"
mkdir -p ${OUTDIR}

# Collect CRDs
kubectl get vpc,vpcattachment -A -o yaml > ${OUTDIR}/crds-vpc.yaml
kubectl get agents -n fab -o yaml > ${OUTDIR}/crds-agents.yaml

# Collect events
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' > ${OUTDIR}/events.log

# Collect logs
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=2000 > ${OUTDIR}/controller.log

# Collect agent status for leaf-04
kubectl get agent leaf-04 -n fab -o yaml > ${OUTDIR}/agent-leaf-04.yaml

# Compress
tar czf ${OUTDIR}.tar.gz ${OUTDIR}
echo "Diagnostics collected: ${OUTDIR}.tar.gz"
```

**Option B: Use Diagnostic Script**

```bash
# If script from Concept 5 available
./diagnostic-collect.sh

# Follow prompts:
# - Problem description: "server-07 cannot reach other servers in customer-app-vpc"
# - Affected switches: leaf-04
```

---

**Collect Grafana Screenshots:**

1. **Interfaces Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to Interfaces Dashboard
   - Show leaf-04/Ethernet8 panel
   - Take screenshot (browser screenshot tool)
   - Save as `grafana-interfaces-leaf04-eth8.png`

2. **Logs Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to Logs Dashboard
   - Filter for `switch="leaf-04"`
   - Take screenshot of any error logs
   - Save as `grafana-logs-leaf04.png`

---

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Diagnostic bundle created (.tar.gz file)
- ✅ Grafana screenshots captured
- ✅ All checklist items documented

---

#### Task 3: Determine Escalation Decision (1 minute)

**Objective:** Decide if issue requires support escalation

**Decision Matrix:**

**If you found:**

**Configuration Error (Self-Resolve):**
- VLAN conflict → Change VLAN in VPC YAML
- Subnet overlap → Change subnet in VPC YAML
- Connection not found → Fix connection name in VPCAttachment
- Invalid CIDR → Fix CIDR notation

**→ Action:** Fix in Gitea, commit, verify resolution

---

**Unclear/Unexpected Issue (Escalate):**
- No events, but traffic not flowing
- Events show success, but server can't communicate
- Controller logs show errors without explanation
- Intermittent issues
- Agent disconnecting repeatedly

**→ Action:** Proceed to Task 4 (write support ticket)

---

**Document Your Decision:**

```bash
echo "Decision: [Self-Resolve / Escalate]" >> ${OUTDIR}/diagnostic-timestamp.txt
echo "Reason: [Brief explanation]" >> ${OUTDIR}/diagnostic-timestamp.txt
```

---

#### Task 4: Write Support Ticket (2 minutes)

**Objective:** Document issue with clear problem statement and diagnostics

**If Escalating:**

Create file `support-ticket.md`:

```markdown
# Issue Summary

**Problem:** Server-07 cannot reach other servers in VPC customer-app-vpc despite successful VPCAttachment reconciliation

**Severity:** P3 (Minor - affects one server in dev environment)

**Impacted Resources:**
- VPC: customer-app-vpc
- Server: server-07
- Switch: leaf-04, Ethernet8

**Started:** 2025-10-16 11:00 UTC

**Recent Changes:** Created new VPC customer-app-vpc and attached server-07 (first server in this VPC)

---

# Environment

**Hedgehog Version:**
- Controller: [from controller-version.txt]
- Agents: [from agent-versions.txt]

**Fabric Topology:**
- Spines: 2
- Leaves: 5
- Servers: 10

---

# Symptoms

1. kubectl shows VPC and VPCAttachment as "Ready" with no error events
2. Grafana Interfaces Dashboard shows leaf-04/Ethernet8 up with VLAN 1025 configured
3. Server-07 receives DHCP lease (10.20.10.15)
4. Server-07 cannot ping other servers in VPC (none attached yet - VPC has only this server)
5. Server-07 can ping gateway 10.20.10.1

**Expected Behavior:**
Server should have connectivity within VPC (even if only server, gateway should respond)

**Actual Behavior:**
Server receives DHCP, can reach gateway, but connectivity seems limited

---

# Diagnostics Completed

- [x] kubectl events checked - no errors
- [x] Agent status reviewed - leaf-04 ready, interface up
- [x] BGP health verified - all sessions established
- [x] Grafana dashboards checked - interface shows up, VLAN configured
- [x] Controller logs collected - no errors for customer-app-vpc

**Troubleshooting Attempted:**
1. Verified VPC YAML has no VLAN conflicts
2. Verified VPCAttachment references correct connection
3. Checked Agent CRD - VLAN 1025 configured on Ethernet8
4. Confirmed DHCPSubnet created
5. Server gets DHCP lease successfully
6. Verified no permit list restrictions (VPC is not isolated)

**Findings:**
All configuration appears correct. Server gets DHCP and can ping gateway, suggesting basic connectivity works. But full VPC connectivity unclear since no other servers attached yet.

# Impact

**Users Affected:** 1 server (development)
**Business Impact:** Low (non-critical development environment)
**Workaround:** None identified

---

# Additional Context

This is first VPC for customer-app workload. Testing connectivity before attaching additional servers. Uncertain if issue is configuration error or expected behavior when VPC has single server.

**Question for Support:** Is additional configuration required for single-server VPC? Or should gateway connectivity be sufficient validation at this stage?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Diagnostics attached
- ✅ Troubleshooting steps documented
- ✅ Impact described
- ✅ Concise and specific

### Assessment Questions

#### Question 1: Escalation Decision

**Scenario:** You encounter these symptoms:

- kubectl events show: `Warning VLANConflict vpc/test-vpc VLAN 1020 already in use by vpc-prod`
- Grafana Interfaces Dashboard: No VLAN configured on expected interface
- Controller logs: Reconciliation failed for test-vpc due to VLAN conflict

Should you escalate this to support?

- A) Yes - escalate immediately, this is a bug
- B) No - this is a configuration error, self-resolve by changing VLAN
- C) Yes - escalate after attempting one fix
- D) No - wait 1 hour for automatic resolution

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) No - this is a configuration error, self-resolve by changing VLAN

**Explanation:**

This is a **configuration error**, not a bug or unexpected behavior.

**Clear indicators:**
- Event message explicitly states: "VLAN 1020 already in use"
- Event type: Warning (configuration issue)
- Expected behavior: Hedgehog prevents VLAN conflicts

**Self-Resolution Steps:**
1. Check existing VLANs: `kubectl get vpc -o yaml | grep vlan:`
2. Find unused VLAN (e.g., 1021)
3. Edit test-vpc YAML in Gitea
4. Change `vlan: 1020` to `vlan: 1021`
5. Commit change
6. Verify VPC reconciles successfully

**Why not escalate:**
- Configuration errors are operator responsibility
- Event message provides clear resolution path
- Escalating wastes support time on fixable issues

**When to escalate VLAN issues:**
- VLAN conflict message appears for unused VLAN
- Hedgehog allows VLAN conflict (should prevent)
- Changing VLAN doesn't resolve issue

#### Question 2: Diagnostic Collection

**Scenario:** You're preparing to escalate an issue where the fabric controller is CrashLoopBackOff. Which diagnostics are MOST important to collect?

- A) Only controller logs
- B) Controller logs + VPC CRDs + events
- C) Controller logs (current and previous) + events + version info + pod description
- D) Grafana screenshots only

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** C) Controller logs (current and previous) + events + version info + pod description

**Explanation:**

For a **controller crash**, you need:

**1. Controller Logs (Current):**
```bash
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --tail=2000 > controller.log
```
Shows events leading up to crash

**2. Controller Logs (Previous):**
```bash
kubectl logs -n fab deployment/fabric-controller-manager --previous > controller-previous.log
```
Shows actual crash (panic, fatal error)

**3. Events:**
```bash
kubectl get events -n fab --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' > events.log
```
Shows Kubernetes events for controller pod (crash reasons)

**4. Version Info:**
```bash
kubectl get deployment -n fab fabric-controller-manager -o yaml > controller-deployment.yaml
```
Identifies controller version (for support)

**5. Pod Description:**
```bash
kubectl describe pod -n fab -l app=fabric-controller-manager > controller-pod-describe.txt
```
Shows container exit codes, restart counts, resource constraints

**Why other options insufficient:**
- **A**: Logs alone don't show version or pod state
- **B**: Missing previous logs (crash details) and version
- **D**: Grafana shows symptoms, not cause of controller crash

**For controller crashes, focus on controller-specific diagnostics first.**

#### Question 3: Support Ticket Quality

**Scenario:** Which support ticket problem statement is BEST?

**A:**
"VPC not working. Please help ASAP."

**B:**
"I created a VPC called prodvpc yesterday and today the servers can't connect to it. It worked fine yesterday but now it's broken. I tried restarting the controller but that didn't work. The switch might be down but I'm not sure. Can you look into this?"

**C:**
"VPC vpc-prod reconciles successfully (no error events), but server-03 attached to this VPC cannot reach other servers. Issue started 2025-10-16 10:30 UTC after creating VPCAttachment for server-03. All other servers in VPC (server-01, server-02) have working connectivity. BGP sessions up, interface up, VLAN configured correctly. See attached diagnostics."

**D:**
"Kubernetes events show Warning type for VPC. Not sure what to do. Help?"

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** C - Specific, concise, includes key facts and timeline

**Explanation:**

**Why C is best:**
- ✅ Specific resource name (`vpc-prod`, `server-03`)
- ✅ Clear symptom ("cannot reach other servers")
- ✅ Timestamp (2025-10-16 10:30 UTC)
- ✅ Recent change noted (VPCAttachment for server-03)
- ✅ What you've checked (BGP, interface, VLAN)
- ✅ Comparison (other servers working)
- ✅ References attached diagnostics
- ✅ One-sentence summary

**Why others fail:**

**A: Too vague**
- No resource names
- No symptoms
- No timeline
- No diagnostics
- No troubleshooting

**B: Too verbose, lacks structure**
- Conversational, not concise
- Buries key facts in narrative
- Speculation ("might be down")
- No clear problem statement
- No diagnostics reference

**D: Incomplete**
- Doesn't describe actual problem
- No resource names
- No timeline
- Asks for help without data

**Best Practice Template:**
```
[Resource] [symptom] [timeline] [what's been checked] [see diagnostics]
```

#### Question 4: Diagnostic Script Usage

**Scenario:** You're running the diagnostic collection script and it asks: "Enter comma-separated list of affected switches or press Enter to skip:"

You're troubleshooting an issue with server-05 connected to leaf-03, and you've noticed leaf-03 has intermittent BGP flaps. What should you enter?

- A) Press Enter (skip)
- B) `leaf-03`
- C) `leaf-03,spine-01,spine-02`
- D) `all`

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Answer:** B) `leaf-03`

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct:**
- You've identified leaf-03 as the affected switch
- Script will collect detailed Agent CRD status for leaf-03:
  - BGP neighbor state
  - Interface details
  - Platform health
  - ASIC resources
- This gives support detailed switch state

**Why other options are suboptimal:**

**A (Press Enter):**
- Skips detailed Agent collection
- Loses valuable switch-specific data
- Support will need to request this separately

**C (leaf-03,spine-01,spine-02):**
- Includes spines unnecessarily (if only leaf-03 affected)
- Larger diagnostic bundle
- Makes analysis harder (more data to review)
- **Exception:** If BGP flaps suggest spine issue, include spines

**D (all):**
- Not a valid option (script expects specific names)
- Would collect all switches (excessive)

**Best Practice:**
- Collect detailed status for **directly affected switches**
- If unsure about upstream (spines), include them too
- Better to collect slightly more than slightly less

**Example entries:**
- Single switch: `leaf-03`
- MCLAG pair: `leaf-01,leaf-02`
- Leaf + spine: `leaf-03,spine-01`
