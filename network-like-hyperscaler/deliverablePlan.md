# Revised Deliverable Plan

## 1. Certification Branding & Messaging Package  
- Finalize **Certification Name & Title** (e.g. *Network like a Hyperscaler with Hedgehog / Hedgehog Certified Fabric Operator (HCFO)*)  
- Tagline, subtitle, and positioning statements  
- Value propositions (for learners, organizations, partners)  
- Key differentiators and credibility messaging  
- Sample copy: learner-facing blurb, buyer pitch, FAQs & objection handling  
- Digital badge / certificate concept (format, metadata, versioning, renewal)  

## 2. Full Pathway Blueprint (HCFO Pathway)  
- Title and high-level framing  
- Overall duration estimate (≈4 hours core + lab)  
- Pathway map (courses → modules → lab tasks)  
- Metadata schema: tags, prerequisite relationships, optional / background labeling  
- Suggested pacing options: bootcamp vs self-paced modular  

## 3. Course & Module Outlines (Core Pathway)  
For each course (4 courses), provide:

  - Course title, purpose, and learning outcomes  
  - Module breakdown (≈4 modules per course)  
  - For each module:
    - Module title and theme  
    - Learning objectives  
    - Narrative summary / conceptual flow  
    - Suggested demo / hands-on / activity ideas  
    - Lab tie-in pointers (what learners will do or observe in the lab)  
    - Assessment / quiz ideas  
    - Optional side module (background) links / glossary tags  

Courses to outline:

- **Course 1: Foundations / Mental Models & Interfaces**  
- **Course 2: Provisioning & Connectivity**  
- **Course 3: Observability & Health**  
- **Course 4: Troubleshooting, Change Recovery & Escalation**

## 4. Supplementary Modules & Optional Paths  
- Background (“primer”) modules to fill knowledge gaps (e.g. *Kubernetes CRD fundamentals*, *network primitives*, *GitOps basics*, *observability concepts*)  
- An **Installation Overview Course** (not deep technical, but enough for admin awareness)  
- Partner extension pathway: advanced topics, design, integration, advanced lifecycle ops  
- Glossary integration plan (term-linking, tooltip / hover behavior, glossary UI)  

## 5. Lab Environment Integration Plan  
- Description of the pre-provisioned lab setup:  
  - Full Hedgehog fabric deployed with best-practice config  
  - Prometheus + Grafana with Hedgehog dashboards  
  - Argo CD / GitOps with web editor for CRD YAML  
- Mapping of each module’s lab interactions (i.e. what learners will do, observe, or simulate)  
- Fault injection / scenario design for troubleshooting modules  
- Capstone lab scenario specification (set of tasks for certification exam)  

## 6. Capstone Lab & Assessment Design  
- Detailed scenario: tasks to provision, validate, inject fault, recover, rollback, escalate  
- Criteria for success / scoring rubric  
- Integration with lab environment (time limits, isolation, data capture)  
- Instructions / guide for proctoring or automated evaluation  
- Suggested recertification or versioning approach  

## 7. Bootcamp & Delivery Guide  
- Sample schedule (4 hours, with breaks, demos, labs)  
- Slide / demo scripts, timing, and facilitator notes  
- Discussion prompts, Q&A design, checkpoints  
- Guidance for live vs asynchronous delivery  
- Tips for engaging both cloud-native and networking audiences  

## 8. Review / Validation Notes for Content Team  
- Flags and placeholders for SME validation (e.g. actual CRD names, API fields, CLI commands)  
- Points of ambiguity / decisions to confirm (e.g. which diagnostics commands are exposed, error behavior)  
- Suggested alignment to your documentation (linking CRD schema, API refs)  
- Style / tone guidelines (cloud-native, software abstraction, minimal legacy jargon)  

## 9. Deliverable Formats & Handoff Plan  
- Primary deliverables in **Markdown** (suitable for version control, review, editing)  
- Optional conversion into slide deck outlines, handoff to design or training staff  
- README / usage guide for your internal content creators explaining how to interpret and implement the outlines  
- Timeline / sprint plan for content build out, review cycles, iteration

Would you like me to generate a **first draft Markdown package** of this plan or begin fleshing out one of the courses in Markdown?
