# Network Like a Hyperscaler - Master Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Pathway Name:** Network Like a Hyperscaler with Hedgehog
**Certification:** Hedgehog Certified Fabric Operator (HCFO)
**Target Duration:** ~4 hours core content + hands-on labs
**Target Audience:** Engineers bridging cloud-native/Kubernetes and networking domains
**Repository:** `afewell-hh/learn-content-scratchpad` (development) â†’ `hh-learn` (publication)

## Guiding Principles

All content MUST embody the **Hedgehog Learning Philosophy** (see `hedgehogLearningPhilosophy.md`):

1. **Train for Reality, Not Rote** - Focus on workflows, not wizards
2. **Focus on What Matters Most** - Prioritize common, high-impact tasks
3. **Confidence Before Comprehensiveness** - Build momentum and psychological safety
4. **Abstraction as Empowerment** - Teach abstractions as tools
5. **Learn by Doing, Not Watching** - Hands-on with live vlab systems
6. **Teach the Why Behind the How** - Understanding design choices builds adaptable engineers
7. **Modularity & Composability** - Short, reusable, combinable modules
8. **Bridging Two Worlds** - Accessible to both cloud-native and networking audiences
9. **Support as Part of Learning** - Normalize escalation and collaboration
10. **Continuous Learning Over Static Mastery** - Teach how to stay current

- Accessibility check
- Timing validation (15min per module)

### Phase 5: Publication & Launch
**Goal:** Deploy to production learning platform

- Migrate polished content to `hh-learn` repo
- Sync to HubDB
- Create pathway and course JSON files
- Set up progress tracking
- Create certification assessment

## Consultant Document Mapping

### Key Insights from Consultant Docs

**Strong Points:**
- Excellent pedagogical structure (4 courses Ã— 4 modules)
- Clear learning progression
- Emphasis on hands-on labs
- Capstone assessment design
- Modular/composable approach

**Gaps to Address:**
- Placeholder names (e.g., "TenantNetwork", "HostAttachment") need mapping to real CRDs
- GitOps/ArgoCD mentioned but not present in default vlab
- Some assumed capabilities need verification (e.g., fault injection)
- Needs grounding in actual Hedgehog architecture

### Technical Mapping: Consultant â†’ Hedgehog Reality

| Consultant Placeholder | Real Hedgehog Concept | Notes |
|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| "TenantNetwork" | `VPC` | Virtual Private Cloud CRD |
| "HostAttachment" | `VPCAttachment` + underlying `Server`/`Connection` | Binding servers to VPCs |
| Wiring/Topology | Wiring Diagram API: `Switch`, `Server`, `Connection` | Physical topology definition |
| External connectivity | `External`, `ExternalAttachment`, `ExternalPeering` | Border leaf concepts |
| Network segmentation | `VLANNamespace`, `IPv4Namespace` | Resource allocation |
| GitOps | Manual kubectl + YAML (for now) | May need to adjust narrative |
| Diagnostics | kubectl commands + fabric status | Need to document available commands |

## Vlab Environment Capabilities

**Confirmed Available:**
- âœ… Kubernetes API access (kubectl)
- âœ… Default spine-leaf topology (2 spines, 5 leaves, 10 servers)
- âœ… Hedgehog CRDs installed (vpc, wiring, agent APIs)
- âœ… hhfab utility for wiring diagram management

**To Verify:**
- Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- Fabric Proxy (metrics collection)
- Event streaming
- Fault injection capabilities
- Available diagnostic commands

**Default Topology:**
- 2Ã— Spine switches (spine-01, spine-02)
- 5Ã— Leaf switches:
  - leaf-01, leaf-02 (MCLAG pair - "mclag-1")
  - leaf-03, leaf-04 (ESLAG pair - "eslag-1")
  - leaf-05 (standalone/orphan leaf)
- 10Ã— Servers (server-01 through server-10)
- Connection types: MCLAG, ESLAG, bundled, unbundled, fabric

## Quality Gates

Each module must pass these gates before moving to next phase:

1. **Technical Accuracy** - All CRDs, commands, and workflows verified in vlab
2. **Philosophy Alignment** - Embodies learning philosophy principles
3. **Hands-On Validation** - Lab exercises tested and timed
4. **Accessibility** - Understandable to both cloud-native and networking audiences
5. **Completeness** - All required sections present per authoring guide

## Project Management Approach

### Issue-Based Tracking
- All work tracked in GitHub issues
- Issue templates for modules, courses, research tasks
- Labels: `phase-1-research`, `phase-2-design`, `phase-3-content`, `course-1`, `course-2`, etc.
- Milestones for each phase

### Pair Development Model
- **Course Lead (Claude):** Process adherence, quality assurance, architecture, planning
- **Dev Agent:** Research, content drafting, lab testing, technical validation
- All agent dispatches via GitHub issue comments
- Preserve course lead context by delegating legwork

### Documentation Standards
- Living documents: This PROJECT_PLAN.md, technical mapping docs
- Everything else: GitHub issues
- Keep repos clean and organized
- Development: `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/learn_content_scratchpad/network-like-hyperscaler/`
- Publication: `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/hh-learn/content/`

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- All lab exercises work in vlab
- All CRD examples are valid and tested
- Timing targets met (15min modules, 4hr total)
- Zero technical inaccuracies

### Pedagogical Success
- Learning philosophy embodied throughout
- Clear progression from confidence to competence
- Accessible to target audiences
- Hands-on labs enhance understanding

### Project Success
- Clean, organized repositories
- Comprehensive issue tracking
- High-quality, reusable content
- Ready for open source release

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Research & Discovery
**Next Actions:**
1. Create GitHub issue structure and templates
2. Create detailed technical mapping document
3. Verify vlab observability capabilities
4. Dispatch dev agent for vlab exploration and CRD documentation

**Blockers:** None
**Risks:**
- Consultant assumptions may not match vlab reality (mitigation: thorough research phase)
- Context overflow (mitigation: aggressive delegation to dev agent)
- Scope creep (mitigation: strict adherence to learning philosophy and ~4hr target)
