# Network Like a Hyperscaler - Master Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Pathway Name:** Network Like a Hyperscaler with Hedgehog
**Certification:** Hedgehog Certified Fabric Operator (HCFO)
**Target Duration:** ~4 hours core content + hands-on labs
**Target Audience:** Engineers bridging cloud-native/Kubernetes and networking domains
**Repository:** `afewell-hh/learn-content-scratchpad` (development) → `hh-learn` (publication)

## Guiding Principles

All content MUST embody the **Hedgehog Learning Philosophy** (see `hedgehogLearningPhilosophy.md`):

1. **Train for Reality, Not Rote** - Focus on workflows, not wizards
2. **Focus on What Matters Most** - Prioritize common, high-impact tasks
3. **Confidence Before Comprehensiveness** - Build momentum and psychological safety
4. **Abstraction as Empowerment** - Teach abstractions as tools
5. **Learn by Doing, Not Watching** - Hands-on with live vlab systems
6. **Teach the Why Behind the How** - Understanding design choices builds adaptable engineers
7. **Modularity & Composability** - Short, reusable, combinable modules
8. **Bridging Two Worlds** - Accessible to both cloud-native and networking audiences
9. **Support as Part of Learning** - Normalize escalation and collaboration
10. **Continuous Learning Over Static Mastery** - Teach how to stay current

## Consultant Document Mapping

### Key Insights from Consultant Docs

**Strong Points:**
- Excellent pedagogical structure (4 courses × 4 modules)
- Clear learning progression
- Emphasis on hands-on labs
- Capstone assessment design
- Modular/composable approach

**Gaps to Address:**
- Placeholder names (e.g., "TenantNetwork", "HostAttachment") need mapping to real CRDs
- GitOps/ArgoCD mentioned but not present in default vlab
- Some assumed capabilities need verification (e.g., fault injection)
- Needs grounding in actual Hedgehog architecture

### Technical Mapping: Consultant → Hedgehog Reality

| Consultant Placeholder | Real Hedgehog Concept | Notes |
|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| "TenantNetwork" | `VPC` | Virtual Private Cloud CRD |
| "HostAttachment" | `VPCAttachment` + underlying `Server`/`Connection` | Binding servers to VPCs |
| Wiring/Topology | Wiring Diagram API: `Switch`, `Server`, `Connection` | Physical topology definition |
| External connectivity | `External`, `ExternalAttachment`, `ExternalPeering` | Border leaf concepts |
| Network segmentation | `VLANNamespace`, `IPv4Namespace` | Resource allocation |
| GitOps | Manual kubectl + YAML (for now) | May need to adjust narrative |
| Diagnostics | kubectl commands + fabric status | Need to document available commands |

## Vlab Environment Capabilities

**Confirmed Available:**
- ✅ Kubernetes API access (kubectl)
- ✅ Default spine-leaf topology (2 spines, 5 leaves, 10 servers)
- ✅ Hedgehog CRDs installed (vpc, wiring, agent APIs)
- ✅ hhfab utility for wiring diagram management

**To Verify:**
- Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- Fabric Proxy (metrics collection)
- Event streaming
- Fault injection capabilities
- Available diagnostic commands

**Default Topology:**
- 2× Spine switches (spine-01, spine-02)
- 5× Leaf switches:
  - leaf-01, leaf-02 (MCLAG pair - "mclag-1")
  - leaf-03, leaf-04 (ESLAG pair - "eslag-1")
  - leaf-05 (standalone/orphan leaf)
- 10× Servers (server-01 through server-10)
- Connection types: MCLAG, ESLAG, bundled, unbundled, fabric

## Quality Gates

Each module must pass these gates before moving to next phase:

1. **Technical Accuracy** - All CRDs, commands, and workflows verified in vlab
2. **Philosophy Alignment** - Embodies learning philosophy principles
3. **Hands-On Validation** - Lab exercises tested and timed
4. **Accessibility** - Understandable to both cloud-native and networking audiences
5. **Completeness** - All required sections present per authoring guide

## Project Management Approach

### Issue-Based Tracking
- All work tracked in GitHub issues
- Issue templates for modules, courses, research tasks
- Labels: `phase-1-research`, `phase-2-design`, `phase-3-content`, `course-1`, `course-2`, etc.
- Milestones for each phase

### Pair Development Model
- **Course Lead (Claude):** Process adherence, quality assurance, architecture, planning
- **Dev Agent:** Research, content drafting, lab testing, technical validation
- All agent dispatches via GitHub issue comments
- Preserve course lead context by delegating legwork

### Documentation Standards
- Living documents: This PROJECT_PLAN.md, technical mapping docs
- Everything else: GitHub issues
- Keep repos clean and organized
- Development: `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/learn_content_scratchpad/network-like-hyperscaler/`
- Publication: `/home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/hh-learn/content/`

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Research & Discovery (Day 2)

**Completed Actions:**
- ✅ GitHub issue structure and templates created
- ✅ Dev agent dispatched for vlab exploration
- ✅ Day 1 research deliverables: VLAB_CAPABILITIES.md, OBSERVABILITY.md
- ✅ Critical curriculum adjustments identified (Issue #4)

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 Waiting for switches to initialize
- 🔄 CRD_REFERENCE.md (pending switch init)
- 🔄 WORKFLOWS.md (pending switch init)

**Next Actions:**
1. Wait for switch initialization
2. Capture real CRD examples and status fields
3. Document kubectl-based workflows
4. Complete technical mapping (Issue #2)
5. Begin Course 3 redesign

**Critical Findings:**
- ⚠️ **Observability is opt-in**: No Grafana/Prometheus in default vlab - requires external stack
- ⚠️ **No GitOps/ArgoCD**: Plain kubectl + YAML workflow
- ✅ **Excellent topology**: All major redundancy patterns represented
- ✅ **Kubernetes-native**: 20+ CRDs, rich status fields, events

**Curriculum Impact:**
- Course 3 needs major redesign (kubectl/status/events instead of Grafana)
- Remove GitOps UI references, focus on kubectl workflow
- This is actually pedagogically advantageous (simpler, focused)
- See Issue #4 for full details

**Blockers:** Switch initialization (expected delay, not concerning)

**Risks:**
- ~~Consultant assumptions may not match vlab reality~~ - VALIDATED, gaps identified
- Context overflow (mitigation: aggressive delegation to dev agent) - ON TRACK
- Scope creep (mitigation: strict adherence to learning philosophy and ~4hr target) - MONITORED
